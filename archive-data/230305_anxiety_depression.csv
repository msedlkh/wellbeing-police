My research proposal is due in four days and I'm not even half way done and even the quality and validity of the little I've done is being questioned. I have tried so hard to keep my shit together this semester. Ive actually been working so hard through the tears and breakdowns multiple fucking times a day. I'm so tired. I'm just so so tired. Why isn't anything working. Why am I so bad at this?! I don't want to graduate a year later. I can't stay one more year. I just can't. I don't want to go through this anymore. I'm tired,1677957189.0

I’ve been on 300mg for roughly 5 years. First year was great. Quit smoking, more stamina, dropped 70 pounds (working for the Forest Service so 5+ miles hiking 4 days a week), didn’t crave bad food, etc.
Now 4 years later I feel like I’m back where I started. Weight came back, cravings/binging is back, body aches because of pushing myself too hard and now exercise is excruciating. I feel hopeless.

I already have an appointment with my doctor to go over everything. I am considering asking about a temporary hunger suppressant but most interfere with bupropion. I’m worried about not taking Wellbutrin at all because it sounds like I’ll just gain more weight.

Has anyone had a similar reaction? I feel like I’m alone at the end of a road and I don’t know which direction to turn. Please share your experiences and any advice. TIA",1677963453.0
3,How do I figure out what my redeemable qualities are?,3,11icbsb,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/11icbsb/how_do_i_figure_out_what_my_redeemable_qualities/,1," I don’t know how to convince myself that even if I graduate with a 2.9 GPA, get a low paying job, and don’t become a doctor that I am still lovable and worthy of life. I can’t see or find my “redeemable qualities”, so if I am not reaching the ambitions I set at my 10 years of age, I am failing myself, my mom, and wasting my potential. On the same note, once my mom finds out that I am gay, she will hate me even more. Because I don’t feel like I have redeemable qualities and everyone eventually leaves, if the one person that is supposed to love me unconditionally (my mom) no longer does, I won’t see the point in living. So I feel like my anxiety is trying to keep me on my toes, trying to make me be hyper aware of every flaw, hoping that I fix them so that I can find some way to be lovable because then I wouldn’t feel like my life will be over if I don't achieve my goals and then I will be able to rest. It is paradoxical though because it is that same anxiety that prevents me from being able to succeed in the way I’d need to reach my ambition anyways. Idk its a whole mind fuck and I don’t know where to go next. I know I somehow need to find my redeemable qualities and learn to believe that I am lovable whether I reach my educational, financial, ambition goals or not, but I have no idea where to start. Any suggestions would be wonderful.",1677961846.0
4,Feeling unsafe in the world,4,11i9v7f,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/11i9v7f/feeling_unsafe_in_the_world/,1,"

Hellluuu, 
my name is Maggie and I'm 20 years old. I have struggled  with mental illness a lot in my past and have been in treatment for 6 years. My issues were never really gone, they just became manageable and I was able to distract myself from them. I moved out of my parents house 2 months ago and my issues are taking over my life again. I get very anxious and overthink a lot. It's keeping me from focussing on reality and the 'here and now'. I often feel unsafe in the world. I think about my position as a human on this planet and realize that I dont matter and have absolutley no control over my life and what will happen in the future. These thoughts are intrusive. I've had these thoughts before about 2 years ago and somehow managed to get it under control again and just live my life somewhat peacefully. But it seems different now, I feel alot less safe in general and it's way more difficult, almost Impossible, to handle my anxiety. I guess I'm just stressing about things I cant control, but i can't stop. 

Have any of you experienced this? 
How did you deal with it? 
Can you give me some tips? 

Thanks in advance!

There’s a levels of sadness, that’s normal to feel

But then there’s sadness where you need help to heal

You lie in bed staring at the wall

Wishing you could shrink away from it all

Where every organ in your body is hurting

And words fail you and negative thoughts are inserting

“I wish i was dead”, “I can’t do this anymore”

It goes on an on, as you stand behind your internal door

Trying to shut everything out

That’s the sadness I’m talking about",1677969617.0

7,Going with the flow?,0,11hvesf,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/11hvesf/going_with_the_flow/,0,"Most of us have experienced it.

That feeling of being totally absorbed in the moment. So immersed in what we’re doing that we’re not aware of time passing or what’s going on around us. In fact, we’re almost completely unaware of anything.

This is Flow – being ‘in the zone’. 

Mostly, flow happens spontaneously. However, the conditions for encouraging flow are known:

· You know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other. 

· You get immediate feedback. 

· You know that what you need to do is possible to do even though difficult. 

· Sense of time disappears. 

· You forget yourself. 

· You feel part of something larger

· What you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake. 

The pioneering researcher in this area is Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (pronounced cheeks-sent-my-high). In the PERMA model, flow maps over most closely to positive engagement – apply your signature strengths to activities that create meaning for you, value for others and legacy for the future. Now, while Martin Seligman is the name every-one associates with the PERMA model and Positive Psychology (a name even its ‘inventors’ do not like!) more generally, Mihaly was one of small group who met in that first week of 1998 to agree the substance of this new field of psychology: to use what we know to help people live their best lives.

Solution Focused Hypnotherapy combines the best of this new understanding with the Solution Focused approach and the transformative capability of trance to best support you in building and sustaining your own best life.

So, ask yourself: *How will I take action immediately in creating the best life I can?*

I hope you got something useful from this piece: I have posted further quick reads on my own little corner of Reddit – it would be great to see you there.",1677923200.0

10,I want to talk about it...,3,11hgfa4,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/11hgfa4/i_want_to_talk_about_it/,3,"My wife knows I've dealt with depression, anxiety, and suicidal ideation before. She knows I've tried therapy in the past and have been on medications as well. However, I never have felt like my wife really gets it or if she takes it seriously, when I try opening up to her about such things. One day, I was feeling incredibly shitty and just unmotivated, so I didn't do a small load of dishes until the following day. My wife proceeded to go off on me, saying I don't appreciate what she does around the house, that I take her for granted, and that I think only I get to be depressed. I don't handle conflict well, so I didn't say anything in response and let it blow over.

Another time, I tried to explain why I'm so frustrated with work. I've never had any real dreams or goals in life and I certainly never had much support from my family, when it came to the few interests I had growing up. As a result, I've been stuck in manufacturing and retail jobs my whole adult life and I've hated every single job I've held. I'm incredibly unsatisfied with my current job and am now basically trapped, since my wife and I now live in a significantly smaller town with even fewer options for employment. Since I wasted my life and never furthered my education, I lack the skills/experience/certifications to do anything other than more manufacturing or retail work and I dread the idea of spending the next 20-30 years in such a situation.

Yes... I fucking know most of us hate our jobs. Yes... I know I have only myself to blame for not taking control of my life sooner. I don't need anyone throwing this all back in my face, telling me this is all my fault. I know. I fucking *hate* myself for being so listless and pathetic when I was younger. I fucking know this better than anyone and I get almost violently sick to my stomach whenever I try to put my worthless feelings into words and people just write me off.

So, when I've tried telling my wife how anxious and irritable my job has me, I just about died inside when my wife responded with, ""Did you think someone was just gonna hand you your dream job, because you're a straight white man?"" She knows that is absolutely not who I am or what I am about, but my constant whining apparently struck a chord with her and pissed her off, I guess.


That being said, in addition to so many other issues that are weighing down on my mind, to the point that I can't relax, I feel very little joy in the things I used to care about, and how on-edge I constantly feel I am trying to find a doctor to seek medication again. Therapy doesn't really cut it. I just don't want to feel anything anymore. I am miserable. I feel isolated. One minute, I'm ready to break down into tears. I feel hopeless and pathetic. Nothing matters.   The next minute, I'm on the verge of exploding with anger. I hate so much of the world, myself included. I can't focus on anything. My mind is racing and I feel sick. I'm not sure what else to do because I can't justify anything I'm feeling. I just hear others telling me I'm wrong. I have no business feeling this way. I need to check my privilege and all that. I seriously doubt anyone will understand and I can't take hearing those I should be able to trust, tell me I'm full of shit. 

I want to talk to my wife, but even now, it sounds like I'm blaming her. It sounds like I'm being incredibly shitty to her, by admitting I feel nothing positive anymore. How can you tell the person you love that you seriously would be fine with dropping dead tomorrow, and not horrendously offend that person? I honestly feel like my wife would be better off without me. I would be better off without me as well. I want to talk about how unhappy I really feel, but I don't even know what to say. I don't think I can handle being attacked for being honest, but I don't know how to spin this without sounding like a selfish piece of shit. That's how I see myself. It's how I feel like others will see me as well.


If I tell my wife I'm seeking a doctor for medication for anxiety and depression and leave it at that, she's bound to ask why. How the fuck do I explain this? In all honesty, if I lose her, I'm done. I have nothing left. That isn't fair to her to say. It isn't healthy either.


I am drowning and I don't know what to say. I'm tired. I'm anxious. I feel sick.",1677880950.0
11,"I tried group CBT about 8 years ago, and every week people kept walking out. I eventually stopped, as it wasn't working for me either...",11,11h03qg,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/11h03qg/i_tried_group_cbt_about_8_years_ago_and_every/,8,"I have been doing one-to-one CBT for a few weeks over Zoom, and I am struggling with the homework I keep getting set. The counsellor (who is in training) I am finding doesn't explain the homework they're wanting me to do well, and twice now they have actually realised that when I haven't done what they've asked me to do, it was their fault. And I feel like I'm in school by the way they react when I haven't done it the way they would like. 

I also find it hard to do it with a full-time job, a wife, and a son that needs looking after. 
I suffer from anxiety and depression and also struggle with making conversation, which is why I thought I'd try CBT again, but I am honestly not sure if it's working. 

People may laugh, but I am getting anxious about doing this homework. If I had known what was expected of me, I wouldn't have started; I thought it was just the meetings. 
I feel like quitting, but before I do, I would like to know if anyone else has had any success with CBT.

Thanks Everyone

No. But I'm like, really struggling and the mental anguish I feel is frankly exhausting. Doctor said I need to find my own therapist because they're all full around town.

14,Playing life on hard mode,7,11gvqg1,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/11gvqg1/playing_life_on_hard_mode/,2,"Pretty sure I’m one setback from being a mental train wreck. I’m barely holding myself together. 

Ahem.

I’m feeling awful. I’ve spent the last hour being my own therapist because I refuse to get one because I don’t want to bother anyone with my problems Cz why would my problems matter. Other people deal with worse. It’d be embarrassing and a waste of time.

My depression and anxiety are manifesting as always. The usual pain in the chest and feeling like I’m being stabbed through the heart. 

As I said in earlier, I’m being my own therapist trying to reason out what’s the root of my issues. I can’t bring myself to get therapy most days, mostly because I’ll lie to myself saying I’m fine or because I don’t want anymore mother or father figures. And when I can I have issues finding one near me that accepts my insurance. I’ve deducted that I have a huge inferiority complex, I’m a parent child that has had to constantly put other people’s feelings and opinions first (often times at the expense of my own, but again who cares - how I feel isn’t important and I have to be a good eldest son and be an emotional dumpster for everyone else - people need me after all, I’m not allowed to breakdown), and that I have a huge desire to succeed solely because I feel that I have no reason not to succeed and do well, and failure means I’m a disappointment and beneath everyone else- because everyone should be able do what they set their minds to. If I can’t then I’m a failure as a human being.

Recently ive been experiencing great positive vibes with my life. i am grateful and blessed to be here every single day. However, sometimes im TOO happy, makes me feel like im lying to myself. 
i am a victim of past trauma (2018).
i always keep myself occupied. (gym, gaming, painting, ect) as an escape ( i admit).
i love spending time with myself and i feel quite irritated when people disturb my solitude. i go out to eat by myself, movies by myself, concerts by myself (i love my own company).
sometimes i feel like no one understands me, i push people away. 
i rather keep to myself, so no one really knows how my life is going really.
despite loving being a loner, sometimes i break down and it becomes very overwhelming, stressful even. i get anxiety/panic attacks where i cant breathe and start hyperventilating. sometimes i get random negative thoughts. not sure what im missing but i feel empty and numb. i sometimes use weed as an escape (which i acknowledge is bad).

i just want to understand myself the best i can, cause as much as i love being alone, i feel like im beginning to spiral and all of this improvement and positive/optimistic energy is just a way for me to manipulate myself into believing im okay when i might not be. after all, sometimes we subconsciously lie to ourselves (or romanticize things) to cope.",1677816708.0

The dreams and thoughts of self harm/ending it all never get better. 
I have cried myself to sleep off and on for  around 15 years… the self harm as in cutting stopped years ago due to me being tired of people talking about it. Getting told it’ll all be fine soon. Just keep trucking on. All those people left my life. Multiple stating I’m to depressing to be around/talk to. Idk I guess it just seems like no matter what I have tried or thought about trying doesn’t work at all. Idk what causes me to be such an upset mess. Childhood/teenage trauma or just my brain being wired wrong. I’m tired of living and basically everything in my life. 
The only reason I’m still alive is due to not wanting to hurt my family.. mainly my parents who spent my entire life just trying to give me the best life they could afford/give me. The thoughts then get worse thinking about how all the people who left my life due to me being a sad/downer. Anytime anything goes good something comes and crashes to make everything just feel hopeless and helpless. I’m definitely a person who has a lot of mental health issues. Being autistic doesn’t help at all…. if anything I feel it makes everything worse. The suicidal thoughts and dreams never get better, I don’t feel comfortable talking to anyone about it since no body truly cares enough to listen. They’ll always just tell me to “think better thoughts”, “change my scenery” , “do more things out and about instead of being home alone most days” yet even if I try to change things everything falls back to how it was. 
I’m 26 years old. I never expected to live past 21. I couldn’t see a future or could never come up with a plan that made me think I’d have a long life. I know I’ll end up taking myself out. The only thing idk is when I’ll do it. Sisters who truly don’t give a fuck about me. Yet I always just wanted to spend time with them. Parents busy with work. Led me to isolate myself all day everyday when I was 8-15.. 
due to as said above I never felt confident or comfortable with anyone to talk about my SA/grooming I experienced as a child/pre teen. Which hyper sexualized me. Still besides talking 2 1 close friend who was always sexually assaulted.. which means I basically admitted it ti him. But never got into details about who or how many people it was. Having to see 1 of my groomers multiple times a year and sharing a bedroom with him/them when I was 15-18 anytime my parents let them stay the night.
I truly want to be happy, not just content in sadness. Idk why I can’t just find my happiness yet. It seems and feels like I’m meant to feel this shitty my entire life.


It seems like the only things I haven’t tried yet is taking myself out.
Maybe I just don’t belong here, maybe I never have. I feel like such a burden on everyone I ever cared about. Not smart, failing at almost everything I try. The more I try to be happy the more problems seem to come my way. Idk .. who knows maybe I should just give up and give in. I don’t believe many will even notice. I just seriously and honestly have nothing left to try and I doubt it’ll make a difference. I been having these thoughts and dreams since a teen.. if anything they just been getting worse as the years go on.

Moving out into my boyfriends place. I am leaving a very secure prior living situation and in my head I can't stop thinking how this is not going to be nearly as good because I really don't know how this is going to be.

First thought is you should know your bf and should feel somewhat secure in that. But it takes me a long long time to feel that secure with someone. I made the decision with him for this. Partly because i think the experience, even if it doesn't work out, will definitely be something that will make me grow and learn. 

I'm trying to get the negative thoughts out of my head. It's always been a coping mechanism. If I expect the worst, I'll be better prepared when/if it happens. It's very hard not to just say ""I hate everything, this is going to be the worst"". This also really affects my mood toward it and him sometimes. I have experienced this plenty of times before, but usually about less permanent situations.

Thinking. Over thinking. Undermining your own thoughts repeatedly. Nothing seems to make the thoughts stop as you are having trouble falling asleep, you count in your head, “one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.” You say this to help slow your mind down. You find yourself silently screaming. You take a breath in and tell yourself that you can fall asleep, it isn’t that difficult. Just close your eyes, take a deep breath in and out. Okay, now you may wiggle your toes and fingers, gently relaxing the muscles in your shoulders. All the while you mind is still unclear with all the constant chatter. Everything you are trying to do doesn’t seem to be helping. Again and again, you go back trying to drown out every racing thought you are having. It’s not working. It’s not working. You try again, “one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.” Your thoughts are becoming louder and louder here as you are trying your hardest to sleep. You keep fighting it for what seems like an eternity but, it’s only been thirty minutes. You get up and walk around your apartment then, go lay back down. In this attempt in grounding yourself you realize now you seem more awake. You close your eyes in attempt to fall asleep. All the while you are trying to focus on one train of thought at a time. Where do you see your family in 5 years? When are you going to lose the weight? what do people see when they look at you? If you had a baby growing inside, you it would be so weird. I really want a child. If we have a baby. What are you doing with your life? If you get a job, you could buy your significant other everything they have been wanting. That job wasn’t that bad. As you are trying to regain that voice in your head you are counting over and, over and, over one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten Now it is overlapping one, what are you... two everything would be… three just do… four, you know I am going to start… five, tomorrow is… six, you are loved. Seven, you need to...! eight! Never enough… nine! You’re not ever going to… ten! Why can’t I… you say the numbers louder and louder. The thoughts inside your mind are just running though every “what if” that it can. You continue counting to ten until the shouting of the numbers finally overcomes the sound of every though you are having. Eventually the counting fades as all of the thoughts are calming. Now you are focusing your breaths on count. One, two, three, you are inhaling. Four, five exhale. Six, seven, eight, nine, ten, inhale.

It’s like that friend that you’ve known forever but instead of being supportive and happy we have this toxic relationship. I went I therapy for years to get my anxiety under control and I thought I had succeeded. I even started going out with friends (real people) and enjoying myself. However, last week a bomb was dropped on me and BOOM here I am. I’ve lost 4lbs in a week. I can’t eat. I can’t sleep. I really just wish I could dig a whole go in and never come out. I feel like I’m dying. I keep asking myself what I did to deserve this. I feel so lost and angry but I also feel like I can’t feel any of these things because it’s unfair to other ppl involved. I just feel like there’s no hope. I walk around feeling like my stomach is constantly doing somersault but in the worst way possible. My chest feels like a thousand bees are just hanging out. My body feels like it has these micro shakes (if this makes sense) like I’m shivering but less noticeable. I would seriously give my kidney to feel better.  This situation has me feel so hopeless. I don’t have all the information which also makes me feel anxious because how do I know if I’m making the right choices if I don’t know what I’m facing? My partner keeps apologizing which gives me more anxiety but they just can’t help it. Anytime I have any kind of physical sign of anxiety it’s “I’m sorry” and it’s truly killing me. I feel guilty for feeling anxious which I cant help. I try. I try to tell myself everything will work out in due time but I just feel like I have this angry deity just following me around to remind me that I’m worthless. I started therapy yesterday which kinda helped but it was more of a first week info dump. So it didn’t feel helpful. I’m sorry to trauma dump. I just don’t have anyone that I can say this to that won’t treat me like I’m shattering glass or tell me “you’ll bounce back just don’t think about it”. I guess this was to vent sooo I will ask this.

I was trying to fight the feeling, the more I tried to fight it, the more my mind was racing, the stronger the anxiety got. So one of the things that helped me the most with overcoming my anxiety is, that I learned how to feel it. Sounds very weird but in fact whenever I got anxious about something I even tried to make the feeling stronger. Because that is when you realize that you in fact can control how you react to the feeling. You can't control when you are feeling anxious but you can LEARN how to deal with it in a good way.

2rd week on Zoloft, first week I was mainly tired slightly anxiety boost, I started upping to 25 mg instead of 13.5 mg now and this insane lack of motivation or thought to do things, like I can maybe think about how I have to do school for my grade but it really doesn’t matter to me atleast I guess because I personally know that I might complete 1/10 things in the day and I’m “ok” with it enough to stay on the meds to see if it will change. What im wondering is even going to school, on one side im getting increased anxiety and can’t do anything but put the fault on Zoloft, so Zoloft is the “problem” should or is it reasonable not to go to school when I literally just can’t do anything. I very much WANT to do my school it’s not an avoidance of going it’s I just can’t do anything so what’s the point going? I just sit and be on my phone. I want to see some of my teachers to but when im doing nothing else in school because I just can’t man is the demotivating and then having the teachers talk to me like I’m just choosing not to do it I hate it. The same stuff happened when I was waiting to be prescribed my add meds they were the only thing even keeping me going to school for the first week or 2, but now I just want to stay at home and sleep just be done no suicidal ideations but I just want it to be “done” I can’t do it so why am I trying?

About 3 weeks ago I had a brutal panic attack for the first time and went to the hospital by ambulance.

After leaving the ER I had 3 days of continued headaches and brutal anxiety - feeling like it was misdiagnosed, certain it was my heart or brain. Saw a private doctor who confirmed GAD and put me on Sertraline (Zoloft).

I’m having a very hard time. Continued, small panic attacks almost daily and consistent anxiety. I know that some of this is due to early side-effects while adjusting to the meds, but man is it ever hard to convince my brain sometimes that I’m not dying (small, weird pains in random places will set me off)

This sub and it’s members have really, really helped. Reading the stories you share about your experiences with the illness and the medication has really encouraged me to commit and stick it out with the meds in the hope that they’ll eventually help me.

I’d rather not hear anything at all if all I’ll hear is their complaints and degradation of each other. Insulting someone is different from expressing your exasperation about how they do the same things all the time. 
I can barely handle school and a part-time job right now, let alone moving out and trying to live on my own. Why am I so incapable of handling anything? The slightest bit of pressure and I feel like I’ll collapse. I feel guilty to coming late to so many things. 
I feel like this stress is getting to my heart. My chest hurts. Maybe it’ll become something else like heart disease. Maybe it is already a heart condition. Not like my unhealthy diet helps either. 
Logically, I know I’m thin, but I step on the scale and see that I’ve gained weight. I feel guilty. I feel like I should stop eating before it gets any worse. But I don’t. I just eat whatever feeling guilty about my dietary choices all the while. I feel like I’m ruining my body but I can only feel guilty about it. I can’t bring myself to care enough about it to change my habits. 
I feel like I don’t deserve anything I have. I’d just rather not be anything at all right now. I’d rather not have to sit and marinate in these thoughts, yet they happen anyways. Brushing them aside only makes things worse later. 
I hate that I can’t tell anyone anything. Maybe I am being a little b about my life when I have so much going for it. But at the same time, I’d like a break. A real one. Where nothing is looming ahead in the near future. Where I can actually sit in the present and keep enjoying it rather than worrying about the future all the time.

This manifests as a stutter, speaking really fast or not at all, either being ""shy"" or my default social setting of ""hyper and silly"", trembling hands, seeming kind of manic when forced to be around people but as soon as I'm alone, I slump into a lifeless, limp lump of exhaustion.

I also pick at my skin (compulsive skin picking), have OCD and 8 OCD-related motor tics.

I've had this since about age 4 and it was at its worst around age 12-13.

Prozac made this type of anxiety SOOOO MUCH WORSE.

Klonopin helps with this a LOT.

2. Fear / dread / impending doom

This manifests as a constant state of dread and a feeling that something bad is going to happen, not to me but to my parents or my cat. I developed OCD at age 7 due to these feelings and trying to relieve them. Then it kind of went away for a while in my 20s and came back a bit in my 30s.

I think it stems from trauma that started when I was 4 and I lived in constant fear for 10 years.

It has now worsened terribly after another trauma 5-7 years ago, and also as my parents and cat are older so the fear of losing them grows ever more real.

It has now also resulted in chronic depression with anhedonia. I can't enjoy anything anymore.

Effexor made this type of anxiety WAY WORSE.

Please dont think poorly of me, just thinking about how there is no limitations to mental health and its scary.

I was very trusting of her and didn’t suspect anything when hanging out with the guy so I was 100% blindsided when she broke up with me seemingly out of the blue and immediately started dating the other dude. I am now in another relationship, but because  I’ve developed some serious trust issues from my last one and I don’t really know how to handle it. My ex would often check my phone because she was so worried of me cheating on her and would chastise me for hanging out with other girls platonically to the point where I had to hide when I was grabbing a meal with a friend because of how paranoid she was about it, but now I’m afraid I’m starting down a similar path. Last night I compulsively checked my girlfriends phone and saw some saved snap chats  between her and a friend of hers that I know she’d hung out with when she was back home over the winter. I saw one saved message of her saying “I love you” and another of him calling her hot, both from well over a year before we started dating. I mentioned it to her when I saw it, and she reassured me that it was just a friendly I love you message and that it was all just in jest from being friends. She also told me that they kissed once like 4 years ago, but both of them decided that it wasn’t right and didn’t do it again, as there were no feelings behind it. I believe her, or maybe I just want to believe her, especially since I’ve done similar things with my other platonic girl friends when I wasn’t in relationships, and I don’t doubt that when they hung out over winter that it was all platonic, but my paranoia is setting in and I’m worried as all hell. My ex also chastised me for going to parties and stuff without her because she was worried about me cheating on her, which in retrospect  I now recognize is very toxic behavior, but now I can’t help but be worried about the same thing with my current girlfriend because all the what-ifs of if she’ll also cheat are buried so deep into my head because of the mistrust that I am forced with because of my ex. I want to be the best boyfriend I can for my girlfriend, and I really do care about her and we both said we really want to stay together more long term, but I just want to be the best I can for her and leave my trust issues in the past.

I remember being in a terrible bout with existential dread between the ages of 10 and 13. Other issues started to build on top of that, but the existential dread sort of tapered away a bit halfway through high school I think. It especially became much less profound after I started SSRIs. Once in a while though it comes back full force if I see something that triggers it. I love the horror genre because it's fear in a controlled situation and I know I'm not in danger. It's a fun ride for me and escapism from real life horrors I deal with. But I cannot handle the existential horror genre in some stories. I made the mistake of watching a video a few days ago that triggered this feeling once again. 

This existential dread feels all encompassing and like everything is dark, there's something horrible looming ahead that I am powerless to stop, something much bigger than me. It makes me feel almost anticipatory grief or something, forlorn and just bad and like no amount of crying, no warm blanket could ever make it go away... physically, it makes me feel cold and sick, and I have no appetite.

Like don't you wanna do crazy shit? And suffer? And become a multi millionaire that can retire their parents? (Although it would take a lot of forgiving for me to do that💀).

# 

 

The reality is it's all my fault and it's all because I didn't work hard when I had to . I kept obsessing over useless things and now I regret that heavily . I know that visiting doctor make me feel good because it gives me the feeling of being a victim and reassurance that it was not my fault but deep down I know that I am giving excuses and running constantly form my fears instead of facing them .

Throwback to my school life when I was a talented and all rounder kid with great grades in class and was great in extra curricular activities and sports etc . But in my school , there was never any event or fest so I never got a chance to express my talents , So I developed a habit of daydreaming where people appreciating me for my talent and I behave like It's happening in reality , unaware of the fact that this daydreaming habit will become so addictive and dominant that It will lead to serious consequences . Soon I started prioritizing daydreaming instead of going outside and really do something in real like joining an academy or learning new skills . Today I am so addicted to daydream that my focus is so poor that it lead me to a failure in academics and being completely lonely in real life as I don't go outside because of daydreaming habit .

When I see my peers doing good in their lives , It makes me feel regret , guilt , FOMO and self hatred . I avoid talking to the, , talking about them . meeting them because I become so anxious and start overthinking , I start having headaches and so tensed and frustrated . I have a feeling of jealousy , self hatred and anxiety constantly feeling like a failure .

I tried about multiple things to find out my interest but they all were temporary obsessions , nothing else . Also I never had a solid aim or goal . I never had an idea what to do in my life .

I am in the last year of college and in three years , I rarely went to college because it's in my local city and my old schoolmates come there and I feel ashamed to go there . I don't go outside of my house because of the same reason. All my friends went to different cities and are in good college .

I am really conscious about my physical appearance as I have body dysmorphia and Maladaptive daydreaming but I know these things would have never happened if I focused on something productive and having a GOAL in my life .

Every night I have a dream of these thoughts constantly reminding me of my mistakes and everyone else doing good in their lives . Every single night .

I try to cope instead of facing the reality . I know how shit I am addicted to PMO , junks , mobile phone , social media wasting my time . I hate myself . I really do .

I know going to doctor will change nothing But It gives me reassurance . I know that nothing going to be alright but still I try to cope form my reality via daydreaming .

I wish I worked in a better direction that wasting my time on useless things . Buried in guilt and regret . Having no interest in doing anything . I don't like waking up in the morning and going outside .

I know everything is an excuse now . I am such a coward person who has no courage to face his fears .

I really regret missing opportunities in my life .

Sorry for the vent , just wanted to get it off my chest .",1677214852.0

I feel like I’ve hated myself ever since I was at 9 or 10. As a teenager I thought I would have offed myself by now. Because I never planned to be here so long I literally don’t know what I am doing. I still hate myself. I am fat, tall, not traditionally cute in any way. I’m average at the things I like. I’m personable as far as work interviews go, but I absolutely suck at any job I do. I can usually do well enough to get by, until I go through another bout of depression and lose all motivation to put in any effort. 
I am constantly tired. Sad. And I’m good at masking it. I’m good at pretending everything is fine when everything is not fine because I don’t want to feel weak. 
I don’t have a bad life. 
I have loving and supportive parents. A best friend I’ve had since elementary school who loves me for me. And I am lucky enough to somehow keep finding jobs after quitting jobs after getting stressed out. 
Yet my pure disgust for myself, and knowing I’ll never be anything beyond a background character for everyone else sucks. I want to be a mom someday. I want a child to spoil. But I can’t get any guy interested in me. So naturally o know I am the problem.

82,Am I alone?,3,11ak9sc,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/11ak9sc/am_i_alone/,1,"I just realized how quick the years have flown by. I have accomplished absolutely nothing; socially, career and experience wise.

I have never had a job due to my Bipolar disorder and severe general and social anxiety (I also have some OCD and ADHD, compounded with stunted intellect and poverty of thought) and have relied on disability payments and family to support myself—I am a loser and I know it. 

I have zero relationships and still live with my parents whom I pay rent each month when I get my disability payment. Despite desperately wanting a job,I have no skills, am a very slow learner and have no confidence. 

I am  sad, scared and uncertain about my future. (Homelessness eventually?) my math is at a third grade level, I can hardly count change or    Remember basic instructions ffs. 

Anyway….

I feel like I love my family more than they love me, and I can’t blame them with me being unable to socialize without feeling a unique sense of unease and anxiety about how they and people in general perceive of me. I would do the world for them. I am lucky that I have them; my parents, sisters, my niece, aunt and grandparents and I wish I could be a better son, brother, nephew, grandson and uncle because they deserve it. 

I am good at hiding my depressive and manic phases associated with my Bipolar disorder by isolating myself in my room as much as possible so as to not put an undue burden onto people and prefer to deal with things on my own for this reason. I take my meds everyday.

At this point, I just wish I was never born. I am NOT suicidal, just really overwhelmed and frustrated. 

 I have always dealt with anxiety and depression but despite years of treatment—medication, LOTS of different medication, talk therapy, getting out of my comfort zone when possible—things have not improved much and a few things that were getting better so slightly have regressed over the years. 

My anxiety is high almost all the time, especially in situations where I have to be around people regardless of if they try to talk to me or not and the situation. For example:

My grandparents threw a birthday party for me and my niece a couple weeks ago(our birthdays are 1 day apart) and I felt frozen with fear, fear that someone would talk to me—because I wouldn’t know what to say or be able to hide my anxieties which were eating away at me the longer things went on and the week preceding the party. 

I hardly said anything but made it clear that I was grateful for the thought and effort behind the party. I was relieved when it was time to go and felt deeply guilty about that later on. 

My psych doesn’t seem to like me much. Nor do I believe he thinks much of me in terms of my understanding of my issues and general intelligence. He is usually pretty short with our appointments and we don’t have much of a rapport. He is obviously highly intelligent and is nice, but I have so much anxiety that I am unable to coherently articulate what exactly is causing me to feel the way I do and explain,generally, the way my mind works. 

I constantly underplay just how crappy I feel to him after many attempts to cogently provide meaningful, insightful  answers to his questions that would enable perhaps better outcomes in treatment, but failed. I sometimes think about abandoning treatment all together out of frustration.


I have a niece (who I adore and would do anything for) that is beyond cold toward me. She doesn’t seem to like me much and has said so to my face and in front of other people, which hurts my feelings and embarrasses me more than I let on. Sometimes I feel bullied by her. She is young so this could be kids being kids, people say, but kids tend to be pretty blunt with their feelings. This hurts me. She is close to everyone else but me, so …

Then I got to thinking: just who am I close with anyway? And the answer is practically no one—so it’s not surprising that my niece (being as intelligent and inquisitive as she is)—probably just picks up on my own anxieties and insecurities, just like everyone else probably does and has formed a negative opinion of me. 

Anyway, I wanted to post this because I am unable to sleep tonight and was hoping somebody reads this and can relate so that I know I’m not the only one who feels like this.",1677219088.0

I’m an 18 yo male who seems to be suffering with extreme anxiety and health anxiety and it’s taking over my life.

I struggle to leave my bed most days. I get weird symptoms such as phantom smells (a burning smell), on going chest pain which is like a pressure, neck pain and arm numbness. I also seem to get dizzy spells where I feel like I’ll pass out but never do. I’m constantly tired. I genuinely just feel strange and weird like I’m not myself. I feel like I’m going loopy, sometimes I speak and it doesn’t make sense or I feel like I’m talking gibberish. I also feel like I can’t understand people sometimes even though I have. I’m also struggling to sleep and wake up in the night. My brain is constantly thinking of the worse and is telling me I’m having a stroke or having a heart attack or I’m diabetic or I have cancer. I seem to also be stressing about the fact I’m stressing and it’s a never ending loop. I’m scared I’ll stress myself sick.

I have been to the hospital a couple times and have had ecgs, blood tests, ct head scan, mri, chest xray and a neck and chest echocardiogram. Sometimes my ecg is a tad bit abnormal and changes but they don’t believe its a cause for concern. All my other tests have came back clear and they cant seem to find anything wrong with me but yet I’m still worrying they have missed something. My symptoms feel so real!

But I always talk about the things I want, and then don't do them. Or I start them and don't complete them. I unconsciously give myself terrible tremors, lightheadedness and a racing heart just thinking about panic attacks and death. I have a lot of support but need emotional and mental resilience and my OCD gets to be a pain sometimes. I spend a lot of time looking at screens: for study, for leisure, for creative projects, for comfort. They're a short term comfort but can leave me fatigued for hours. The cure for this is to go outside and have a walk but then I have to listen to my thoughts and I don't always like what they have to say. I'm on medication for anxiety, I get plenty of rest and eat a varied diet (though my caffeine and sugar could be cut down) and while I have a lot of friends online, I haven't met up with many people outside the family except at certain events. I have recently started conquering agoraphobia and my fear of being alone due to a mental health group I'm part of and I don't want to slip back to my old ways but this week I had an anxiety attack at my job and while they're not fatal my brain always convinces me I'm inches away from death. I always fear the worst case scenario, try and predict what could potentially happen and distract myself with the media I like until I retreat into it for comfort.

I’m currently back in therapy to try and bring my anxiety back down to a manageable level (amongst other things) and my therapist was saying that because mental illness isn’t given the same validation as a visible physical illness, it can be so easy to put pressure on ourselves to try and do things as if we weren’t living with our illness. I basically only leave the house for work and occasional family stuff. I can barely bring myself to do anything that requires social interaction, yet I miss it so much. But expecting myself to behave as if I don’t have this massive roadblock has really shattered my self esteem. So she told me to just start going easy on myself, not judging myself for doing only what I can handle, and the advice felt so good, I felt so much better. But trying to actually do that, it just feels like I’m encouraging all my depressive behaviours.

It's not the first time I feel that and I have no idea if this a known pathology or no. 
Anyway, about 10 days ago, I watched a movie at my dad's house. It was a sunday night and that weekend, I was feelin' quite great and lively as I was trying to stop going online. 
I'm french and the movie was a mid 70's movie and it triggered vibes and ,I'm guessing, past emotions because of the architecture/atmosphere it showed. And the morning after, all more or less old architecture reminded me of those vibes, and all of a sudden, I was getting depressed and anxious over it. It's almost as if the movie brought back vibes/atmosphere I felt about architecture/surroundings from years ago. 
I've always been someone whose mood could vary because of his surroundings, but this is on a whole other level. I have no idea why this movie triggered such a high anxiety level of response and thoughts from me and why I can't get those vibes out of my mind while doing my business daily, especially going through places I used to really enjoy walking by while letting my mind wander. It's like it took out all the fun of going to do photography (one of my hobbies).

Also, to clarify on a more personal level, I'm still living with my mom, which has multiple sclerosis and is on a wheelchair. It's been a few years I've been here to help her daily, and she can't walk anymore or even go in/out of the bed or toilets alone. Each day is more or less the same, a few caretakers come every day (about 2 hours a day), but my mom hates being dependent on them, so I'm still here. Also my mom being very vocal about things that bother her daily (she also has urinary problems), I tend to almost always be in an anxious kind of vibe. I'm planning on coming back to university this september, hopefully to have some changes in my life, but my mom has to move out closer to the rest of the family / come to multiple sclerosis center.

Been a ‘lurker’ of Reddit for years. Reading threads but never reacting. 

So, heres my first toe in the water. Attached below is a little note I wrote the other day. Im not sure what it is really, but its a slightly humorous look at depression and anxiety.

Let me know your thoughts. 

‘Welcome Aboard the Magical Misery Cycle.’

Im your host. Captain Misery. 
Some of you may know me as Cortisol
You’ll see this is a tandem bicycle.
Theres plenty of room for everyone. 
But just to make sure, all those with anxiety, you get on first, at the front, so you can pedal away frantically and see everything that may be in front of you. 
Those with depression you get on behind. This gives you time to muster some motivation and means we can feel the crippling guilt from watching those with anxiety doing all the work. Whilst we sit in self loathing. 
Mixes of both illnesses you’ll fill the gap in the middle. Don’t worry, it seems like there isn’t enough room, some of those with anxiety will get off at the last moment in a manic panic and some of those with depression will follow, crawling back into bed. This leaves those of us who are classed as functional to pedal round on this grey half empty bike dealing with the world around us. Make sure to put your mask on so the onlookers cant see your feelings. Rite. Lets get on with it. Have you taken your meds?

It just came out of nowhere, although I assume it was probably out of stress from other things. My whole body hurts. The reason it’s this way is because off all the things weighing down on me.

My dream to make it in the film industry and one day be a director. Currently, I’m trying to make a short film, but I had no equipment before so I spent some money to get a new camera and lenses, but I still need other stuff too. One of my actors is leaving in April and I told him i would make this film so I’m on a deadline to finish it, but I’m scared I won’t be able to do it in time. I’ve also been watching a lot of Hong Kong action movies and used to think about them obsessively (my film is a homage to these) and now I’ve started to get sick of them.

Simultaneously I want to leave my city as there’s nothing here for me but I also need to complete this film as I’d promised those helping me out I would. I’m afraid I might end up dead from a heart attack or stroke the way things keep going or end up losing my mind and killing myself. 

I still live with my parents and they are constantly giving me shit, nagging me, and putting me down. It’s not helping and only making me more worried. I’ve been getting into more and more fights with them, saying worse and worse things (although they are the ones who always instigate it). I have never had a good relationship with them, and they’ve always acted like this to me since I was small, and I started retaliating in response.

Most of the stuff they complain about is me spending money, but I won’t be able to pursue film successfully if I don’t practice or even have equipment. 

I’m also still a virgin, never had a gf, and like I said don’t have my own place yet.

I was diagnosed with social and general anxiety 1 year ago, and depression 6 months ago. I was in my senior year of college, and failing all of my classes. I also was struggling with a class presentation. 

       I was sleeping ~12-14 hours a day (lived in an apartment) and eating one meal if I ate at all. I would barely leave my room unless I really needed to go to a class or an exam. 

Got meds and therapy and graduated, and I have been living back at home since June 2022. I am currently job hunting. 

I am having constant discussions that turn into arguments with my dad. He keeps telling me that I need to “just not be nervous” and “don’t think about things that might make you nervous” and to “just do it”. 

        For example, I am struggling to go to the animal shelter I volunteer at. My goal is to go 3 days a week but I usually only go 1 day because of my anxiety and nerves, and also not being ready in time to leave because I waste time and get up late—> I still have lots of problems with motivation and depression. 

      My dad wants me to just go. But he can’t understand that so many things go into that. I have to think about what to wear.  The weather. Making my hair look a certain way. Worrying about being worried at the shelter. Worrying about getting in trouble at the shelter (has not happened, just an anxiety hang-up). Getting the energy to actually leave the house.  

How can I explain to him that I cannot simply turn off my worries and get energy out of no where and “just go” ?

Constant loop of not giving a shit while worrying about it as well

Worrying about everything in general

Being hypersensitive emotionally

Feeling worthless

Having difficulty with confidence

Panic attacks under stressful situations

Anxiety attacks that paralyze me for a short period of time

Severe difficulty breathing, strong and fast heartbeat and the feeling of having my organs clutched usually a result of panic attacks

Severe difficulties with socializing, often leaving me drained mentally after one evening with people and making me recharge several days

Feeling anxious and sad around confident and attractive people

Being overly self-aware

Severely intrusive thoughts

Adaptive disorder

Inability to concentrate on multiple tasks at once, sometimes to even concentrate at all

Massive memory holes, being forgetful all the time

Inability to properly react to life situations

- Pretty much my whole life I’ve always been anxious about something (going to nursery, the school bell, the headteacher, vomit, unwanted sexual thoughts, my self esteem)

- My worst moments were Nov-Dec 2019 and July- December 2021 for various reasons 

- I have awful intrusive thoughts to points where it scares me to the point of me thinking everything is over

- I suffer with the worst confidence which leads me to fearing love and rejection 

- I feel like there is no one special in my life

- my introvert nature makes me even more angry and upset

- I once had a panic attack because I saw someone better looking than me (due to my intrusive thoughts and self confidence)

- I’ve never had a girlfriend which makes me even more lonely

- I see people get on better in my college class which makes me even more upset comparing myself to them

- (Nov- Dec 2019) I was scared of being gay…for the record I’m not, I had intrusive sexual thoughts 

- (July - Dec 2022) i experienced loneliness, FOMO, worst holiday ever, the worst rejection I had experienced, the worst year at school (that being y11)

To give some background, I've been on Zoloft with pretty good overall ""evening out"" of my anxiety and depressive symptoms for the past 3+ years. At the direction of my doctor, I started weaning off slowly... with every decrease I felt pretty typical physical withdrawal symptoms (nausea, dizziness, mild headaches, lightheadedness). But now that I'm completely off, it's majorly different. I had the same physical symptoms initially and then it went away without any major issues... so I'm thinking I'm out of the woods. Then out of the blue about a week ago I get hit with the WORST emotional breakdown I've had in probably a decade. I couldn't even categorize it as anxiety because it felt like everything all at once. Like blazing rage at everyone and everything in my sight. Cry-screaming feelings of hopelessness. Deep pit of depression. I tried to exercise, listen to music, do my normal ""soothing"" activities and nothing even touched it. It just made me feel even worse. I honestly thought I was mentally dying. This continued for 3 days before slowly waning. 

Now I'm still terribly anxious and irritable but it comes and goes. I have frequent episodes throughout the day including as soon as I wake up. Anything can trigger it. I feel hopeless and often like I don't want to exist anymore. Is this normal for 5 weeks off? Reason being--I want to know if this is still withdrawals because if it is, I can push through hoping it gets better. I know it will never be at a completely anxiety-free level, but if this intensity is my ""new normal"" I have no idea what to do.",1676755156.0

When that wore off (and I reached the highest dose) I started adding Buspirone (Buspar) with the Citalopram.  After Buspar wore off, I was put on Wellbutrin.  After Wellbutrin wore off, I was put on Cymbalta (Duloxetine 60 mg) .  That did not do anything.  And remember, I am taking all of these together.

After about 6-7 weeks on Duloxetine, my doctor prescribed me Adderall IR 20mg.  The Adderall worked the best out of all of them; I mean, it really worked.  I didn't feel high, but I felt **happy and motivated.**

And here I am, **Day 10 of the Adderall,** and it has completely wore off.  Maybe I'll feel a little more calm, but that's really it, and it doesn't last long.  I have zero motivation and zero happiness.

I have two children under 5 and I often have repeated scary thoughts of them being injured or killed because of freak accidents. Then when something does happen I feel a high level of fear that is disproportionate to the situation. For example my daughter was recently trying to put a sticker on the wall in the bathroom while she was peeing (she’s 4, so basic 4yo stuff lol, I was running her bath at the time) and she fell off the toilet headfirst. I must have asked her a dozen times if she was really okay even though she caught herself with her hands and it was literally the most slow-motion fall I have ever seen. Looking back it’s clear to me that this is so silly.

I’m trying my best not to let my own fears impact their feelings of security because I can recognize that, for example, the possibility of my two year old forcing the baby gate open and falling to his death on our stairs is extremely low. But this scene plays out in my head. The image of one of my kids accidentally cutting off a finger with the kitchen scissors or somehow getting a hand caught in the garbage disposal plays out in my head and it scares me even though this is a minuscule risk. I want my children to be brave and confident but I get such awful worry about them. My own mom’s worries were constantly placed onto me in childhood and I don’t want that for them.

I know I have always had some minor anxiety issues, but nothing I haven’t been able to overcome before. The anxiety was most intense right after they were each born probably up to their first birthday and then slowly tapering off. I would like to have another child but I’m scared of the anxiety increasing again if I do; it was worse after my second child because I was having thoughts about both of them, especially thoughts of them being hurt or killed due to my being inattentive or negligent somehow. Leaving a knife on the counter and them knocking it into their face somehow, etc. But even after 2 years since my last baby the thoughts still trouble me a lot and I’m wondering if there are some basic coping mechanisms or a way to reduce their frequency without medication.

Y’all don’t know me, or my life. I’m hidden, behind this screen and within the four walls of my little bedroom. 

So, I’m gonna use this post as something of an opening statement. 

The basic facts: 
1. I’m a chickadee from a little Texas town. 
2. I’m gay (lesbian if you’d prefer). 
3. I’m just about through with high school. 
4. My mother is my favorite person in the world.


Now, what’s driven me to come to Reddit: 
1. Well, I’m gay. That’s certainly something. 
2. I’m also coming to terms with the fact that, while I may be romantically attracted to ladies, I’m not sexually attracted to anybody. 
3. I’ve closed my social circle to less than 10 people. 
4. I’m suffering with some severe social anxiety. 
5. I’m depressed. 
6. I’m terrified of getting my driver’s license. It makes me nervous. 
7. I can’t sleep at night. For reasons unknown, though I have an inkling it’s due to my anxiety.
8. I cannot control my sarcasm and scathing comments in my day-to-day life. It’s really getting to be a pain in my rear. 
9. While I’m sophisticated in text, when I speak it’s like talking to a sailor during a game of poker. 
10. I’m overweight, short, and it makes me feel bad. 

That’s all I’ve got for now. Of course, maybe it’ll change in a few weeks, or months. 

In short, I am an anxious, gay, insomniac high school Southern Belle. 
And here I am, on Reddit.

In the hopes of helping my back pain and to maybe feel less insecure about my appearance but it didn't help anything my back still hurts just as much if not more and physically I may be less round and heavy but it's been replaced with being saggy and wrinkles that look just as bad. All I feel like I do is wait, fail, or nothing happens no matter how much effort I put in to the point that I just feel like nothing gonna happen like I feel in disbelief anything I do will actually work out for example getting my GED yes I'm getting it but nothing will change after that there is still no job where I live that isn't a high stress physical labor work environment which I can't work because of my back pain and mental health. Then there's socially as I said it wasn't good in school and got way more negative experiences than positive then after I left it basically died except for my online group but that has basically died except for maybe 1 consistent friend and 2 spottier ones I hang out with but that's it that's the extent of my social circle not counting the 2 family members I got and there's no way to improve it because I live in a dying Midwest sundown town that has nothing to do except bars or slots. Finally there my non existent love and sex life I've never been in  a real relationship I've technically dated 4 people but it was always long distance and nothing ever lasted a week and ended once by me being dumped cause he was a friend experimenting, the others ghosted me and the last one was 5 years ago and then anything physical just seems like fantasy to me if not because I'm insecure about my body almost completely with loose skin, eczema all over my body except for my face, I am still fat, because I'm fat and my penis is average plus I'm a grower it makes it look like I have a micro dick when I'm flaccid, and all of that mixed with being average looks and no job, no car, no public transportation, zero income, poor mental health, and living with my mother still why would anyone ever be attracted to me and honestly idk if I even have a type or standards anymore simply because it seems impossible that some oned want me.

You ask from the other side of a computer screen

I don’t know I want to shout, kind of like everywhere

I feel it it my stomach, in my gut first

It starts to clench and twist and turn like no other

Then I feel it in my heart and it starts to beat out of my chest

Then i feel it in my skin, the vibrations and electricity running rampant

Then of course my head is spinning like a madman and I got crazy

So I guess my anxiety is centered in my gut?

***

Our battle front is our own mind and you Can take control.

I had a really cool chat with a community member yesterday, I’m so grateful that our paths crossed, it was a real eye opener for me, I was left a little bit mind blown.

The long and the short of it is we share very similar battles however we are coming at them from different angles so we sort of filled in some blanks for each other which was super cool. I learnt about OCPD, I knew about OCD but not OCPD so as this person provided me insights on the topic a light bulb went on in my brain. 

I shared a couple of my own insights during our chat that I hadn’t discussed with anyone before, which was why I had probably had not heard of OCPD before. Thanks to the support and encouragement I received from this awesome individual, I’ve decide to post my insights for my fellow warriors in the hope that they may resonate with someone else and help them on their own battle front.

I turned the tables on my obsessive, perfectionist mind and used it against itself. I shifted my focus away from all the outside world obsessions and focused solely on becoming the best version of myself I could be. I visualise my mind like an office space, there are internal memos, external memos, thing I can action (aka control), things I cannot action (aka out of my control). I found organising my mind like an office space, tagging and filing everything that comes across the desk (aka my mind) has been a huge help in pretty much cutting out the excessive noise (aka obsessive thoughts)

To do that I needed to became an observer** of what my mind was doing, I became obsessive about understanding it of course but in this instance my obsessiveness was an advantage because you really have to keep working on it. I wanted to know why I think, react, feel the way I did about whatever situation I found myself obsessing over. To really observe, I needed to remove all emotions from the situation, that is really important but also very difficult, we have essentially become extremely “emotional” beings. The goal is to reach a point where you own how feel about a situation but you don’t succumb to those emotions every time you think about it. 

My experiences have led me to believe that there is a relative logic in everything, sometimes you need to dig deep, other times the logic is easy to find. My mind loves logic, so once I found the logic of situation, I would keep reminding myself of it every time I realised I had started obsessing over it again. Eventually my mind started reminding itself, I didn’t have to consciously pull myself up. 

To give a broad example. We can endlessly obsess over what may or may not work for us as we battle away with MH, whether it be deciding to seeing a therapist, a psychiatrist, taking medication, not taking medication etc We can compare notes with each other and research till the cows come home, but in doing this we are essentially fuelling our battle front. The logic/truth is, we cannot truly know what is best for us until we find it. The mind will never find an answer to all the potential what if’s and maybe’s because the answer is in the doing. Remind your mind that you are working on getting the answers it seeks but it’s trial and error, there truly is no one size fits all, no matter how similar your experiences are with someone else. 

I am not at all suggesting that no one should discuss or share experiences, there is definitely value in that but learning to keep it in perspective prevents it become fuel on the battle front.

169,My Mom’s a total attention whore,1,1138kxh,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/1138kxh/my_moms_a_total_attention_whore/,0,"Before I begin, I just have to say that my Mom is good and I love her. My relationship with her is good, but it’s true she drives me absolutely insane. To the point where it causing me anxiety. Her parents didn’t really pay attention to her, so I see one reason why she’s an attention whore. 

The reason behind this is because she’s absolutely incapable of shutting up. Whenever she’s home, I hardly get any alone time which I do need. I haven’t had alone time with myself, which I always need, for 2 weeks. Even to talk to friends online. 

A couple weeks ago, she needs help in the garage nonstop, because she’s short and needed my help from the rafters. I went to talk to my friend and she immediately busted in and said “no! I need you to help me more!” I swear I was about to tell her “shut up!” 

Thing is she had to raise me, because my Dad worked full time. My Dad often stuck up for me against her when I needed to be alone. After he died, I believe she saw every opportunity to utilize me to get what she wants. 

The worst thing is that she makes me do everything. She even has to shout at me from across the house when she can’t just knock on the door and ask me something. And the sad thing is there’s a reason why. 

The reason? She’s addicted to Facebook. The reason for that? She has to have something to bitch about all the time. Because bitching is how she gets her way for attention. 

My sister and I have been noticing her Facebook addiction and incapability to shut up. Problem with me is I’m too spineless to tell her to put Facebook down and make her shut up. I have to wear headphones a lot and distract myself with music or videos. 

I don’t know what to do to ease the anxiety without wanting to lash back out. That’s why I have trouble calming down. Anyway, I’m sorry I wasted your time.",1676495282.0

I had a a traumatic childhood and looking back I suffered with anger management, and was always the class clown seeking for attention/acceptance. However, this first came to light as a problem when I left university and started my first job. After two days I quit as it wasn’t what I expected and thus started to experience severe anxiety attacks. I think this was due to the fact I had built it up in my mind to be the perfect job and that everything relied on this decision, as I had no safety net or family support to fall back on. This is were the obsessive thoughts started to creep in, and it just spiralled to a point were I couldn’t step foot in a ‘work’ place environment. 

Over time since since this happened (2years approx) with medication and therapy (CBT) I have managed to enter the work place again and have been in this role and job for the last 4 years. Albeit in a low pressure job that I felt comfortable doing, I have managed to buy my first home and get my life back on track. As a result of my previous experiences, I now feel trapped and scared of doing anything different as I feel vulnerable as it has become so big in my mind to the point if anything changes at work it will cause me severe panic attacks, and I won’t take any promotions due to my anxiety around the workplace as I am scared of losing everything. 
 
Further, I am a very obsessive person and am a perfectionist. For example, I am very formal and have rigid mannerisms, such as I need to know where I’m going and vet the area before I go. I will research every decision to the finest detail, this could be simply choosing a new tyre on my car or where I should invest my money. I am a all or nothing person with an addictive personality, and have now made the decision to stop drinking alcohol as I couldn’t carry on drinking the way I was. I wasn’t drinking everyday but when I drank I couldn’t stop and would black out. These are just a few examples of my behaviours. 

I am seeking advice as I’m getting worked up and feel like I’m at a crossroads. I don’t feel like I’m living my life fully, don’t have a routine and am struggling with my anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder tendencies. I am currently taking Sertraline 150mg, however I spoke with my GP a few days ago as I have been experiencing tension headaches, therefore the GP has recommended to drop my dose to 100mg and see if the headaches go away, and if not then to add in amitriptyline 10mg.

When my body feels heavy, stiff and sore, usually because I’ve been glued to my bed for weeks as I wallow in despair, I turn to my Jump Start Your Arse playlist that is full of music that makes my body move….so I dance.

If I’m feeling low, slow and powerless, my Uplifting playlist is packed with songs that empower me, my own personal jam is Crazy by Gnarls Barkley, the lyrics and beat just resonate with me, because I really did lose my mind and that song just speaks to me and reminds me that someone else knows that place.

Lastly, my depressive, anxious mind, oh how it can consume me, drain me emotionally, give me tension headaches for days on end. The chilled vibes playlist is perfect for that, it’s completely instrumental, no lyrics to set my mind off again into a rabbit hole, just easy beats to soothe my mind and gently rock my body.

we had a great Friday together, but he was very grumpy on Saturday. On Sunday he slept all day and turned his phone on silent which he never does. he's way too responsible for that. He has some family obligations and I've never experienced his phone on silent mode. 

and i think i see it in him, too. his eyes are tired and sad. his posture is really bad. he barely smiles.

i need some reassurance. i used to be depressed for many years and this sounds like depression to me. yes?

and it's getting to me. because my mental illness background, among depression, is that i always assume it's my fault when someone doesn't talk to me. he has yet to read my two messages from yesterday. they were nothing to respond to. just wishing him a good morning, hoping he's had a good night, and a couple hours later telling him that I'm here for him if he needs someone.",1676365064.0

184,Not coping with new job,6,111s7br,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/111s7br/not_coping_with_new_job/,6," (32F, suffer from anxiety, depression and overthinking). I'll make this post short. I have recently started my first ""real"" job at a high school cafeteria. We are understaffed and the work is very fast and we are expected to do everything. Serve hundreds of students, clean, set up areas, dishes etc. I am trying my best every shift but I've found myself breaking down crying when they called me in to work later today. I've gotten this job right as my depression was starting to get worse, and I think I am definitely not coping with this. I find myself thinking how long I have until my next shift.

I am not on antidepressants (never have been) and the wait time to see a psychologist is beyond ridiculous. It sounds stupid but I am hesitant to take antidepressants purely because I've heard they can make you gain weight. I've spent the last 2+ years losing over 130lb/60kg and I still have to lose more. But I am struggling to lose weight lately. I think because I have been so stressed from all these new changes. 

Is it a stupid reason not to want to take medication? I am also depressed because of another person in my life and don't think taking antidepressants would do much. I would be even more depressed if I saw that I had gained weight.

Just tell me straight if I am being unreasonable here.

I find myself wanting to cry every day at random times. I feel hopeless, nothing to look forward to, low self esteem, and physically and mentally exhausted. I'm constantly overthinking and making myself feel worse. My mood is always low these days and find no enjoyment from doing anything (for example, i have no motivation to watch or play something).

If I did take antidepressants, how would they help me?

Which medication would be best for anxiety as well? My heart is racing throughout my entire shift and I really hate that feeling so much.

Sorry if this post is all over the place.

189,Are you Limiting Yourself?,3,111fyrz,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/111fyrz/are_you_limiting_yourself/,1,"We all form a set of beliefs in our childhoods: generally, they are formed rationally and serve us well at the time. However, time moves on and things change. As we become adults, our childhood beliefs serve us less well – and the resultant behaviours may be incongruent with the situation we are in. This leads to the conclusion that one of the things it means to grow up, is to develop out of our childhood beliefs and adopt a new set of beliefs that will serve us better as adults. This progression follows a broad pattern of developing from dependence as children to independence as young adults to interdependence as mature adults. 

Our overall set of beliefs are developing all the time. However, most of us will carry some of these childhood beliefs with us in to adulthood. Most will be innocuous but some of them may impede our performance as high functioning adults. Many adults benefit from contemplating this list, recognising any that apply to them and working on growing out of them. They can be thought of as limiting beliefs – and we all have them.

The general list is:

· I need everyone I Know to approve of me 

· I must avoid being disliked from any source

· To be a valuable person I must succeed in everything I do

· It is not OK for me to make mistakes. If I do, I am bad.

· People should strive to ensure I am happy. Always!

· People who do not make me happy should be punished

· Things must work out the way I want them to work out

· My emotions are illnesses that I’m powerless to control

· I can feel happy in life without contributing back in some way

· Everyone needs to rely on someone stronger than themselves

· Events in my past are the root of my attitude & behaviour today

· My future outcomes will be the same as my past outcomes

· I shouldn’t have to feel sadness, discomfort and pain

· Someone, somewhere, should take responsibility for me

Beyond these, we can have our own specific limiting beliefs which are often versions of I’m not good enough / I’m not worthy / I’m not smart enough / I’m unattractive / change is bad / conflict is bad / the world is a scary place / people are mean ect.

Simply reflecting on the above may point the way to a resolution. Working with a hypnotherapist is particularly well suited to personal development in this area as – by its very nature – it opens up the pathways between the parts we know and recognise as ‘us’ and the deeper levels of our wisdom: ideal when are going through lots of changes on our lives. 

It is more effective to work on these with a skilled helper however working through the following questions will provide you with some insight:

· What is the evidence for this belief – and against it?

· Am I basing this belief in facts or feelings?

· Is this belief really black and white – or is it more interesting than that?

· Could I be misrepresenting the evidence?

· What assumptions am I making?

· Might other people have other interpretations of the same situation – what are they?

· Am I looking at all the evidence or just what supports my thoughts?

· Could my thoughts be an exaggeration of what is true?

· Am I having this thought out of habit, or do the facts support it?

· Did someone pass this thought or belief on to me – if so, are they a reliable source?

· Is my thought a likely scenario, or is it the worst-case scenario?

I hope you found something useful in this short piece. I have posted more quick reads on my own little corner of Reddit – would be great to see you there.",1676312404.0

I struggle with depression and other things but I also love my life. I love my wife and family. I obsess over the thought of death and it consumes me.

In addition to that I went to psychiatrist because once I hit max dosage of the first medication and wasn’t feeling how I had expected to feel I needed a psychiatrist to determine which additional medication could be introduced. After months of 2 daily medications plus something a little stronger for those really bad days I was so disheartened that I wasn’t bounding off the walls with happiness and motivation. 

I had been working with my psychologist during that time too, but I felt I’d hit a bit of a wall. The medication had reduced the severity of my panic attacks but the depression side of things hadn’t seen any markable improvement. I was really at a loss, how do I un-depress myself? I genuinely wished I wanted to do something other than laying on my bed streaming show after show, but I didn’t actually feel like doing anything so I didn’t.

I had times where I’d force myself to give something other than streaming a go, I decided to paint a little cupboard, that took months to finish and I only finished that because it was taking up space in my Dad’s shed and I felt guilty about that. After the cupboard debacle and the effort that required, I thought a move to sitting down activities would maybe make a difference so I then tried paint by numbers, it’s unfinished along with unfinished needle craft, hand sewing projects and a colouring in book with one colour in one corner of one page. 

My depression was making me depressed. I did not want that to be my life, I am so fortunate to be physically capable to do things, I didn’t want streaming to be my life for the rest of my life. 

My Doctor, Psychologist and Psychiatrist where all telling me to just go outside for 10 mins each day, start simple but even that was such a effort, I just wanted my bed.

My depression over my depression continued for months, I tried to reassure myself that somehow I’d figure it out the key to breaking the cycle but the situation weighed on my mind all the time to the point where I no longer enjoyed streaming. What do I do now, I was at a loss. 

As I reflected on my new depressed about depression frame of mind, it dawned on me that I’d become so consumed with finding the solution that I had emotionally drained myself of what little joy I had. So I took a break, I stopped analysing my emotions and thoughts and rested, I watched paint pour videos, volume off, for hours on end, just mindlessly staring at the screen but it was visually appealing to me. I enjoyed it.

I eventually moved out of that funk, it just took time.  

What I understand now is that the analogy of the layers of an onion is so true when you’re dealing with emotional baggage and a SAD (Stressed/Sad Anxious Depressed) mind, you peel off a layer and think you’ve made such a major development and you feel pretty good for while only to find yourself slipping back down and you realise there are more layers to peel away. It can be so difficult to stay on course and not give up, it’s really hard, it is an uphill battle. So take a break on an outcrop on the hillside, take pride in the fact that you are doing the work, and you are moving up the hill.

The truth is, even when you start to see markable changes in your mood and thoughts, you still find yourself trekking up the hill because it has become empowering, you are living the rewards of your hard work. As you emerge from that heavy, emotional cloud you’ve been under you start to see perfection in imperfection and there is great comfort in that, a comfort companion as you continue to climb.",1676243091.0

I change things out at times, for a long time all my tech stuff was close, I don’t know why that was important but it was, maybe because it made me feel that I had the ability to reach out to the world that I felt so removed from?

At this moment I’ve got some “outward” push, but more than likely I will retreat into myself again when something pops up that sends me off balance. 

Regardless of whether I have outward push or not, mental health is a passion(?) of mine. I see many people close to me dealing with mental health issues of varying degrees, unfortunately as I mentioned in my post “Own your Grumpy, Own Your Mental”, my family are not sharers of feelings so any attempt I make to share my experience and offer support falls on deaf ears. 

Mental health issues are so common and I know from experience how lonely and frightening it can be, even with a support network of Doctors and tons of medication keeping you propped up.

Talk about a never ending rabbit hole of doom and gloom! 

Somewhere I came across the concept of letting go of what you cannot change and taking control of what you can. Not a new idea but one that I hadn’t considered applying to my own life.

It took considerable effort to implement this new “moto”, I had become so accustomed to obsessing over everything that falling back into old habits happened without me realising.

I created “spaces” in my mind, one for the things I couldn’t change and one for the things I could. Organising my thoughts like that really helped. I wasn’t ignoring my thoughts and fears, just sort of prioritising them. 

When it came to things I could change I didn’t find that all of sudden I had all the answers or the motivation to implement the solution but by knowing that I was working on, that my intention was to resolve the issue provided me a feeling of control, something I’d lacked in my life for a very long time.

As a single mother my responsibilities to my child heavily outweighed my own needs. Things came to head several years ago, I was really struggling with every aspect of my life and as I started to reflect on my life, looking for a reason why, I uncovered a cycle I’d been going through for more than a decade. Every 6-12 months I’d fall unwell with terrible flus or bouts of exhaustion, usually resulting with several weeks off work. For a number of reasons I thought it was my job causing me stress so I set about to find myself a new one, a change is as good as a holiday. That was far from the truth in this case. I found the transition difficult, not new job difficult, cripplingly difficult. I didn’t recognise myself at all, I felt completely emotionally and physically overwhelmed, getting up and ready for work each morning was a step by step process, only as one step was completed I could think about the next, if I thought any further ahead than that I burst into tears. 

One perk of my new job was being able to work from home, after a couple of months I started working from home a couple of days a week. Not having to get out of bed to work was a dream, but my concentration was none existent, I was fidgety, aimless and extremely emotional. I kept it together for several more months before I finally came apart for good and I quit. Funnily enough, even then, I thought I needed some time to re-energise, I had emergency money and I figured this was an emergency. 

Time didn’t work either, I was falling deeper and deeper into something and I was getting scared so I finally went to my Doctor. Severe anxiety and depression, yep, ok, I didn’t really know what that meant really as far as it’s impact on my life but I got medication and a Doctors Certificate. It wasn’t until I got home and read the details of the certificate that I broke down, it said 6-12 months recovery time. No, that wouldn’t work, I couldn’t take that sort of time out. In that moment, feeling that my life was spiralling out of control, I fell even deeper into the pit of depression and anxiety. Back to the Doctor, more medication and referral to a psychologist. 

It took a long time and a lot of being honest with myself before I started treating myself like someone with severe anxiety and depression, owning it, forgiving myself for having it, not being ashamed and to start making choices in life that were in support of a healthy life for myself, learning to put myself first. Since then I have unpacked a lifetime of baggage, one big question I had was why did I not see how unwell I was? 

I’m still adjusting to the new me, I’m not who I was but the person emerging is easier(?), I know myself better, I am more comfortable within my own skin and I’ve never felt that in my entire life. I am a work in progress and I will keep working on myself.

Reading over this post it all sounds so simple but it wasn’t. It has been the challenge of a lifetime, it’s been lonely and highly emotional. I am relieved to say I survived, the reality is I may not have.

By the time I understood that I was suffering from severe anxiety and depression I had cut myself off socially so even having a friend to offload to was not an option. Reaching out to my Doctor and talking about my feelings was a step I took out of sheer desperation. I was fortunate to find a Doctor who showed true concern and empathy. 

If you are not as fortunate as I was in your search for a Doctor, please do not give up. Some people, including Doctors, do not know how to support people with anxiety and depression, it may well be that they grew up in an environment where they didn’t talk about feelings so they come across very clinical which is not what you need. I’m not saying that is ok, in particular from a Doctor. but that is the reality. Do not be deterred, do not feel dismissed or unvalued, Keep looking for the Doctor who is right for you. 

I live in Australia and am very grateful for the support available to me from the Australian Government. I was entitled to Centrelink benefits which included free Psychologist appointments. I often get annoyed with my psychologist, I can snap defensively at things they say and I have ended sessions because something was said that really got to me. I always go back though because I want answers as to why I have such crippling anxiety and depression but honestly, most of the work is done outside the psychology session.

Growing up I wasn’t one of those kids that always asking “but why?” but as someone working through a really screwed up mind, I ask why all the time. I ask why after ever psychologist appointment. I reflect on what we talked about and recall my verbal and emotional reactions to questions or comments made by my psychologist. Did I get defensive or did I feel uplifted and why did I react that way, what other situations or people bring about that same type of reaction from me. I really want to understand the root cause of my extreme emotional response to things.

After months of therapy, I now reflect on any interaction that upsets me, no matter how justified I felt in that moment, I don’t want to create upsetting situations for myself. I cannot control what other people say or do but I can work to control what I say and do. My emotions con be on top of me before my mind has fully comprehended the situation, it’s a knee jerk response cause by years of undiagnosed depression and anxiety. My brain is permanently wired to react with panic and high emotion. I want to change that.

Over the past few years I have been extremely difficult to be around at times, I have learnt to accept that, depression and anxiety can creep up on me and I can find myself reacting to things in ways that make me cringe on reflection. But it’s the reflection part of the process that brings about the biggest changes.

Own your grumpy, apologise when you need to, I talk about my anxiety and depression to my family, not that I expect any great showing of understanding or empathy but it is what I am dealing with and as my Doctor pointed out to me, if I had a broken leg there would be things people wouldn’t expect of me, like popping down the street for them. While my family can’t see my disability, it still is a disability and I have my challenges because of it. 

Do not be ashamed, do not feel guilty, own it and work on it, use whatever support is are available to you and you will take steps forward, small at first but much bigger as you keep at it. Oh, and be patient with yourself, ease up on yourself when you need to because this takes a dedicated effort mentally and you can and will get tired.",1676208538.0

(I have not made an attempt it's just dark thoughts and feelings)

She knew about it one time I had an awful day during high school and the school counsellor had to call her because I wanted to end myself (Not actually kill myself but as feelings and thoughts) and recommended that I take a day off and see a psychologist. Which I did for a couple of sessions and kinda had to stop because I felt guilty about her paying. (I don't remember if she cried when she found out and had to pick me up from school. 

And today I was talking to her about ADHD and how they co-exist with anxiety and depression and potentially seeing a psychiatrist instead. She was also worried about me being dependent on medication and tried to give me tips like exercise, eating healthy, sleeping better, etc. 

I have done all of this advice and tips from the school, online and stuff. I felt frustrated, and upset and was crying during the conversation because it was really hard for me to talk about and told her about what's it like for me and ways of ending myself (again just thoughts like a car accident for example). 

I regret it because I made her cry it broke my heart and she rarely cries. She was always a tough and busy woman who had a hard life and bad luck in her country and she will always be the woman who inspires me to be better, strong, and happy and build a better future for myself and I can't keep depending on her like this cause she's not going to be here forever. 

She was glad that I could talk to her about anything but I feel horrible for burdening her like this... I probably should not have said anything and wish I could take it back.

So I made plans to attend my step-mom’s birthday dinner tonight, and all I can think about now is how irritated I am that I have to go. It’s not that I don’t want to get out of bed (I’m sitting at my desk working right now. WFH) or even that I don’t want to help her celebrate her birthday. It’s even at one of my favorite restaurants in town. I just do not. Want. To go.
It’s not my depression (well, I don’t think it is) and it’s not really that I’m anxious to go out. It’s not agoraphobia (I don’t mind leaving on the weekends to do things, as long as it’s only me or myself and my fiancée going). I’m not afraid of being around other people. It just feels like a chore to have to go out and be around other people. I know certain family members I’m not big fans of are going to be there too, but that isn’t fully it. It’s not like I don’t like anyone going. It’s just the thought of leaving my apartment holds the same disdain as doing dishes or paying bills. My family is used to me ‘Irish goodbye’ing it so to speak, as in leaving pretty early and without warning. I just hate spending time with other people. I’m fairly introverted anyway, but the more people I’m around, the less I want to go by multiple orders of magnitude. My fiancée isn’t going, either, so it makes the whole thing even suckier.

Like I purposefully put road blocks in my own path to create personal adversity to overcome it and feel a sense of growth. I had a childhood, but it was filled with domestic abuse, drug abuse, and divorce between parents, step parents and extended family. My dad would tend to take a lot out on me after I hit about 7/8 years old. I live in a pretty small state. I don’t have what I would call friends because I pushed them all away with own antisocial tendencies and inability to feel comfortable and secure in attachment. Maybe a result of my relationship with my parents, but I’ve been trying really hard to be my own person with saving up for a car, getting a promotion, a pet, a beautiful girlfriend, a best friend again, and soon to be going to the gym. I smoke w€€d sometimes and nicotine more frequently to take the “edge” off (don’t try at home kids). Part of me feels that my negativity toward life could be attributed to by the two substances, but I’ve always had Major Depressive Disorder, Clinical Anxiety and PTSD. I found out from my mom that my has BPD and that I should watch for it. I don’t know if I’ll get better, but I want to. Lately I feel like I’ve been running out of reasons to keep pushing because it’s hard to do it for myself. I love my girlfriend very much and have antisocial tendencies which upsets her often and I try to explain I’m trying, but I just feel that it’s not enough most of the time. I feel like a grand underperformance in life and sometimes like I’m ready to provide in a relationship materialistically, but I can’t help to feel shut off sometimes scrolling through life. Hobbies are hard this time of year because it’s cold. I’m not asking for advice, but if you have helpful motivators I wouldn’t be opposed. I genuinely feel like this has been a long lasting sickness since childhood and I’m having an early adulthood crisis of wondering if I’ll be like this forever no matter how hard I try to be positive, work hard, and treat the people I love with respect and care.

You’re trying to concentrate on your work, and your mind wanders off to a completely unrelated topic. Or maybe you’re about to go on a first date, and all you can think about is how horrible your last few dates have been.

**Unhelpful thoughts can be distractions or be destructive.**

Your mind is incredible. When you manage your thoughts, you have your mind working for you. Imagine how powerful you would become if you could ignore or replace your negative thoughts! You could accomplish more and get greater enjoyment from your life.

These strategies can help manage thoughts that don’t support you:

**Maintain space between yourself and your thoughts.** You don’t have to engage with your thoughts. You don’t focus on every person, tree, and car you pass when you’re driving down the road. Most of these things pass through your awareness without you pursuing them further.

● You can do the same thing with your unhelpful thoughts. **Allow them to simply pass on by.**

● Your thoughts are simply something that you experience - you are not your thoughts.

**Recognise that it is your brain’s nature to produce random thoughts.** The thoughts you experience say little about you. It’s the nature of your brain to produce thoughts. It’s always going to give you something to think about.

● Occasionally those thoughts are useful. Frequently, they’re frivolous. Sometimes, your thoughts can be quite disturbing. We have evolved to pay more attention to negative thoughts: with self-awareness we can see them for what they are and then move on.

**Meditation is a helpful tool for understanding the nature of your mind.** The first thing you notice when you attempt to meditate is the random and restless nature of your mind.

● **Focus on your breathing.** When you find yourself fuming about your boss, wondering what happened to your high school friends, or making a mental grocery list, simply redirect your attention back to your breathing.

**Focus your attention on a thought of your choosing.** You can think about anything you choose to think about. You can think about riding a flying bicycle, eating a lemon, or what you have chosen to accomplish today.

● When you’re experiencing an unhelpful thought, you can decide to think about something more useful. **Recognize that you have the ability to direct your thinking as you see fit.**

**Apply logic.** Poor thinking leads to poor decision making. When your thoughts are leading you astray, put your logical mind to good use. Ask yourself what a sensible person, or your role model, would do in this situation. What would you advise a friend to do?

Are negative or distracting thoughts getting in your way on a regular basis? You’re not alone. The human brain loves to stay active and will wander from one idea to another until you take control of it.

**The key is to focus your attention on what you choose, recognize your random thoughts for what they are and allow them to pass.**",1675976359.0

It's been more downs than ups for me. I can't even feel my breathe anymore and that's not even an exaggeration at all.

Due to anxiety I feel like I can't take a deep breath at all. This has been going on since I got my first ever panic attack. Things just went downhill really quickly. 

And to make matters even worse I also suffer from health anxiety which has honestly made me feel so paranoid. Everyday feels like doomsday and I can't ever relax because of it. I could watch a movie peacefully and then my heart would start beating fast out of nowhere which then just triggers a lot of panicked thoughts and then that cycle never stops. 

I barely ever talk about my issues because it feels To me that these days nobody cares if you have mental issues it seems. It's sad because I remember opening up to my family and I thought they would be supportive but then they ended up saying some unnecessary shit that weren't helpful at all which in turns made me feel so defeated and even more hopeless than I already felt

People who don't have any mental disorders really don't get how debilitating and how awful it can make you feel. It take away all your joy, all your motivation and it turns you into a numb person without a human soul. 

I've been trying to work through it and as you all know sometimes it's hard and sometimes you just don't have any energy to want to be productive. It's even harder for me since I don't really have any emotional support on my side and if I did I would've been so much better now and I would have felt more alive by now. 

And before you suggest ""a therapist"" I have tried that before. I've even talked to one recently and at first they asked me for $70 and they said that it would be a one time payment or whatever but then for the next therapy session I received a message that I still need to pay an extra $200 💀💀💀

It's annoying because I thought that the mental health plan would cover the cost of my therapy sessions but turns out it didn't cover anything at all and I had to pay the full fee which in order just made me give up. 

So there's that! But what I've been using is hotlines where you can talk to people about your issues. It's free of charge so I do use that many times a day but I don't know why somehow it still doesn't feel like it's enough. I still do want to have a good friend at least who I can talk to about anything because those hotline people are random strangers and I'm not really used to the idea of spilling my dirty little secrets to random ass strangers. I have to at least know them personally in order for me to open up a bit hard so as you can see that's harder for me. I do say things but I say them in a way where it's super vague just so I don't sound too specific to my situation. 

As for my family we barely ever talk. Like honestly my family and I have never gotten along well. Maybe when I was younger it was a different story but nowadays we're just total enemies. It's frustrating because you would think that maybe they would've cared about me since I don't know...maybe because I'm THEIR SON??? 💀🤦 Talking to them is like talking to a wall or a teddybear. Both will give you NOTHING. 

I literally talk to myself everyday because if I don't do that I'll fucking go crazy. I feel like a part of me has already gone crazy and it's too late for my brain to recover now. I have way better conversation with myself than I have with them that's for goddamn sure!!! 😩😩😩",1675931167.0
239,How to deal with anxiety after coming home from new job?,1,10xlnlo,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/10xlnlo/how_to_deal_with_anxiety_after_coming_home_from/,2,"32F. I’ve just started my first “real” job. (I’ve posted a few days ago). I suffer from anxiety, depression and get overwhelmed easily. I’ve started working as a catering assistant at a high school. We are very short staffed, so have to do a million different things throughout the shift. No one has really told me what I have to do because they are so busy and I’ve had to keep asking. Today I served in the senior dining hall and it was absolutely flat out. My heart was basically racing throughout my entire 3 hour lunch shift and I really don’t like that feeling.   
 

I thought I did a good job today; I felt dizzy all day though and I got overwhelmed slightly when the food ran out and didn’t know what to do because no one told me. So.. I came home and feel exhausted physically and mentally. When I arrived home I suddenly wanted to cry a bit and felt overwhelmed after my shift.  
 

Does anyone have any tips on dealing with anxiety after my shift? I find myself thinking about how long there is until my next shift and by doing that, I’m getting myself worked up in advance. ☹

241,"(Can anyone relate?) Everyday I have to keep myself mentally distracted otherwise I can break the ""illusion of happiness"" and then feel depressed.",11,10wrxv0,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/10wrxv0/can_anyone_relate_everyday_i_have_to_keep_myself/,1,"So yeah, this is a relatively new ""problem"" I've been experiencing that started last year and has plagued me constantly since. Context: I am a long time sufferer of Anxiety and Depression (Treatment-Resistant), and also ADHD and somewhat autistic. But I am in a better place mentally right now than I've been in years; in my own little corner of life, I've been finding fulfillment in a job that I believe in (and also allows me to work from home) and legit love doing the work, I've made some life-decisions that have allowed me to have more free time to pursue things that matter to me — one big thing is orchestral music composition, and I'm super excited about the musical growth I've been having. I love the hell outta my wife (coming up on ten years now), we've got an amazing relationship. We moved into a new apartment last year, and it's a GREAT place....

All of this say: by and large, my day-to-day is honestly pretty great right now. There are some big picture issues and such, but at the ground level I'm doing pretty well, better than I've been in years. But one nagging issue I've been dealing with SINCE things started turning around for me is... Well, it's hard to explain, but I'll try: basically what happens is that whenever I feel in a good mood or happy or excited, if I think too deeply about what I'm feeling, I will have this sort of internal ""Eeyore"" that's like ""But... why?... Why feel happy or excited about this or that? What's the point in feeling happy about this?"" And if I focus too much on that ""voice"" and those questions, it's like the ""illusion of happiness"" gets broken, my balloon is burst, and I'll start feeling depressed or emotionally blank and tired, and it will often last the remainder of the day.

So basically my only hope is to try to keep myself from thinking too deeply about my positive emotions. I have to keep my thoughts at a surface level when I feel good. Otherwise I will ""hear"" the questions, and that will be the end of it.

And you can probably imagine what this is like.... It's like that thing where someone will say ""Don't think about pink elephants""... But then, of course, everyone who hears this command can't help but immediately think of pink elephants. So it's a really irritating issue to deal with, because if I know I'm not supposed to think about that ""internal Eeyore"" then my anxiety is like ""But what if you think about it!"" and then BAM, I'm thinking about it. So stupid.

And I'm not even sure what the questions mean. Like, do the questions mean ""what's the point"" in an eternal/universal sense?? Is it that there's part of me that thinks what I do with my time is meaningless? Or afraid that's the case??

I really don't know. But I know it's annoying. The fact that one simple thought has the ability to derail my entire day is just ridiculous and frustrating.

So yeah, I'm curious if this sounds familiar to anyone else? Is this some weird sort of demented price I'll have to pay for feeling better, and I just have to learn how to wrangle it?",1675846791.0

Those moments definitely hurt, if its a friend, a family member or your partner...they are going to happen. The moments when you disappoint yourself tho...when you know you should have done more but didn't...the moments when you could have tried harder yet still couldn't seem to...

Moments like those are rather gut wrenching, especially when you're an overthinking, anxious, depressed mess of a human like I am. I can't seem to bring  myself to be stronger then what I am right now. Its taking everything I have just to wake up or go to sleep. To remember to eat and take care of my pets. To shower an brush my teeth, to take vitamins and drink water.

It's taking everything I am just to hold on right now, to not be completely swept under by my depression. The lack of me being able to do the things I know I need to do...get a job, pay for my car, the insurance, my phone, gas, food, and savings for the life I want. All that I need to do...all that I want to do, the weight of it all is crushing down on me.

I got a divorce an I am relieved my marriage is over...but so are all the things I had built towards in the last 7 years. Now it's all memories and experiences, leaving me with a very real fact that where I am now, the life I have now...is at ground zero. I am at less then foundation level,..the blueprints barely more then an idea scratched on a napkin...there is so much I have to do to get my life going, so much I have to do just to suport myself to even a fraction of what I want to and yet...


All I am, goes into just getting up to get cereal in the morning, when I remember to feed myself at all.

I've had two different job offers and accepted them both, only to back out before I started. One would keep me far away for long portions of the day with no real garentee of any solid schedule. The other to labor intensive seeing how the last 5 years of my life I've worked a stationary job, so my body would have a hard time adjusting. Both jobs full time and pays decent enough but just not what I want or felt I could handle.

These are the justifications I tell myself and others who ask, yet a big part of me just laughs...because I could do either of these jobs. I am capable, my body and mind would adjust and I would find my rythem in a few months then I would be on the way to being okay!! 

I KNOW I CAN DO THESE THINGS!!!

I told him if I keep having these stage's of my life don't you think it would have worked? He said "" try again"" I just sent a blank stare because my friend was yelling at him I understand his perspective yk a friend can only do sm until the others are on their own But I never once asked for his advice I just wanted someone to comfort me and tell me it is okay Which he has done before He'd call me when I was upset Or send me comforting videos and it all helped Why would he do that?

I’m 32, suffer from anxiety, depression and overt-thinking everything. This is my first ""real"" job. Today was my first shift and while I think I did fine, I keep feeling like I wasn’t good enough. There were so many different things that I had to do, particularly with loading/washing the big commercial dishwasher. My supervisor showed me everything they do, but there’s so many steps. I just kept saying “yes”. But I feel like I’ve forgotten some things. My heart was racing all day and now that I’m home even though it was just a 4 hour shift I feel mentally and physically drained.  
 

How can I actively remember things the ladies tell me? I suppose because I’m anxious some of the things just go in one ear and out the other since it’s like an information overload.  
 

Another thing I am worried about… grabbing the bain marie food trays and food pots. They are so hot, and I burnt my fingers several times even with gloves. ☹ I’m scared I’ll end up getting a fright and dropping something. Work doesn’t provide head resistant gloves or something.  
 

Why am I worrying about these stupid things? I’m worried I can’t do a good job. I came home and honestly just want to cry even though I didn’t do that bad. My depression has been really bad lately. I don’t take anti-depressants (and don’t want to) and can’t afford therapy/the wait time is ridiculous. Could this job be a good way for me to overcome my anxiety and depression since I’m actively forced to speak with people?  
 

I feel like I did a good job interacting with the students while I was serving. I pushed myself to talk to everyone and greet them with a big smile.  
 

Another thing I am worried about is, most of these ladies at work are older and have been there for years. They love to gossip and talk crap. I don’t want to get involved in that. ☹   
 

I have a 3 hour shift tomorrow and I just.. want to ask for some advice on how I can approach my work day. These days because of my depression, I am starting to just feel nothing. I want to cry all the time. And I feel like one of the reasons I am depressed is so stupid but can’t help it. I have a (guy) friend who actively avoids my messages, sometimes for a week or two at a time. He’s done this since I have known him. If he’s having a hard time because of work or feels depressed he avoids. But I guess I overthink things too much and think he just hates me. This sends me into negative thought spirals and I end up feeling worse.  
 

I want to learn how to stop overthinking everything.  
 

My sister also started at the same work place today but she was fine. She’s the opposite of me and doesn’t suffer from anxiety, can talk to anyone etc. I want to be someone who can do that and not worry about things all the time.

I feel as though the things and feelings im experiencing are unnatural . I feel like im going through walls, through the floor,  side to side , except im not. Like im possibly imagining it but it feels so real. I feel like im flying high above the clouds and it’s scaring me . And I get a sense of dread in my chest quite often and it’s a depressive anxious , doom anticipating feeling I can’t seem to shake. And im struggling to even think of anything is real because of the strange experiences I’ve had . Wondering when I look at TikTok and see something about an advertisement for something and check the comments. All those people who are down to earth discussing products online , I don’t know why that bothers me but it does because I feel like that nothing exists and there are people who are down to earth feeling fine and what I’m feeling feels unnatural. The way my brain recalls it it feels like the worst thing ever , when it’s not. This is because once I break it down I realise my brain is exacerbated it although it’s still scary. I feel like I’m anticipating something very bad coming , like everything doesn’t make sense and I will forever be in a LSD kinda trip for eternity . Unsure where to post this so I’m gonna post it everywhere to increase my chances of finding some relativity in people and we can discuss and possibly hello what’s happening to us.  Anything you’ve experienced I probably have . So even ask me anything unrelated , I just want to feel human again and not scared that I’m in a realm of torture . Thank you for reading .",1675606062.0

it doesn't help that the reason i dropped out was because of my depression. when i went to college with her i felt like i was super happy but then i realized that i wasnt cut out for the college life. im so directionless and my depression made me shut down, i had to drop out.

i feel so guilty for abandoning her and in turn is making me more depressed. i feel like a fucking failure. i failed the most important person in my life; i failed the girl who saved me from my feelings and i cant shake the suicidal thoughts away. 

i have really bad abandonment issues as well.. which isn't helping my anxiety. because of this, the fear of her finding someone better  keeps me up at night.

if anyone feels the same.. please comment or something because i feel like im suffocating on my spit and tears every second im away from her.",1675595078.0

- Sertraline (Zoloft SSRI, 50-100mg) on and off from January 2013 to 2021. It used to take the edge off my irritability but worked less and less over time and then didn't help me. In 2021 it suddenly started making me really angry and irritable so I stopped taking it.

- Escitalopram (Lexapro SSRI, 10-20mg) on and off from 2015 to date. It also doesn't do anything much except soften the irritability, but it's better than nothing.

- Various benzos (Xanax, Valium, Klonopin, Ativan and some other ones like Etizolam, Bromazepam, Nitrazepam and Phenazepam) from February 2017 to date. I now only take Klonopin and have taken 2mg every night for 6 years. Xanax was the ONLY thing that actually worked to take away my specific type of anxiety (that constant dread, doom and fear) AND my anhedonia. I was able to enjoy things, my appetite came back, and I slept better than I had in my whole life...it was amazing. Of course, the tolerance forms and then it doesn't really work anymore. So I tapered off with help from Valium. I prefer Klonopin to Valium so I still take it as it still helps a bit and is better than nothing. Before I took benzos, I barely spoke to people as I was SO self-conscious and awkward. I stuttered and my brain would go blank. Benzos made my stutter mostly go away and I was able to actually be more myself. 

- Doxylamine (Restavit, Unisom, 12.5mg) I started taking half a 25mg antihistamine when I tapered off the Xanax and then tapered down the Valium, as I knew if I had to go back to not sleeping again thanks to my lifelong insomnia, I'd have trouble dealing with anything. I didn't want to take a sleeping pill, and the half Doxylamine worked really well and allowed me to sleep, and it still does 6 years later.

- Moclobemide (Aurorix MAOI, can't remember the dose but it was twice a day) in early 2018 for a month. I felt no change except for immense sleepiness an hour after taking it, that didn't go away even after a month, and I couldn't function when I kept falling asleep all the time.

- Methylphenidate (Ritalin, 5-10mg) in early 2019. Omg. HORRENDOUS. I was diagnosed with ADHD after 30 minutes with a psychiatrist and I highly doubt the diagnosis was accurate, but even so...the Ritalin was a nightmare. I couldn't focus or think at all. My thoughts stopped flowing and I just lay on the couch all day, incredibly tired, dulled, bored and depressed. I was slurring my words, my pupils were tiny for some reason, I had a headache and chest pain the whole 4-5 hours it ""worked"" for. I also ate nothing for 2 days. I normally have no appetite due to anxiety and depression and this made that even worse.

- Venlafaxine (Effexor SNRI, 75mg) in mid 2020 for about 6 months. It amplified my already constant feelings of dread and impending doom and at the same time really pushed my anhedonia way up. It was 6 months of utter apathy mixed with high irritability. I couldn't even be bothered going back to my doctor to get more or try something different, and it was during this time I started sleeping really late into the day. I stopped abruptly, felt no withdrawls or anything, and just went back on the Zoloft I still had at home. I felt slight relief.

- Lamotrigine (Lamictal, mood stabiliser, up to 150mg) in mid 2020. I took this during part of the Effexor time and then part of the Zoloft time, and I may as well have been taking chalk or Tic Tacs. I felt no difference in anything, except after 150mg I became the most lethargic and apathetic ever, and my memory became terrible. I'd be speaking and would lose words. I never left the house. After I went off it, it took about 3 months to feel my cognition return to normal.

- Duloxetine (Cymbalta SNRI, 60mg) in late 2020 for 6 weeks. No good. I felt more depressed than usual, with dark thoughts, and my anxiety worsened. I couldn't find comfort or relief in anything other than sleep.

- Fluoxetine (Prozac SSRI, 20mg) in mid 2021 for 2 months. THE WORST ANTIDEPRESSANT SO FAR FOR ME! I learned that I can't take activating antidepressants as they make me SO hideously anxious, with so much excess nervous energy that has nowhere positive to go. My stutter came back, my hands trembled, my speech sped up really fast, and yet I still slept all day as there was nothing I wanted to do due to the anhedonia. I was also incredibly irrritable and angry all the time. After 8 weeks, I couldn't sleep for more than 2 hours and my insomnia returned worse than ever, and I had to go off it. I stopped abruptly and didn't go onto anything else. I felt ok. It took about a week for the excess nervous energy to subside and it took a month before I could sleep normally again. It was like it negated all the effects of the Klonopin and the Doxylamine.

- Vortioxetine (Trintellix, 10mg) same as Prozac in terms of the irritability and excess nervous energy but less severe. I took it for a month before realising it was just not helping.

- Tramadol (Opioid / Serotonin agonist, 50mg) this was for my constant headaches and it worked well for that, and it was hoped the Serotonergic peoperties would help my mood too. And they did, but only slightly...like for a few fleeting minutes each day I'd feel a lift in both my dread-feelings and my anhedonic boredom, but it was so brief and then it was gone. Then after 2 weeks, it stopped doing that entirely. It's too potentially addictive to increase the dose and keep taking it long term.

So...it's quite depressing (no pun intended, lol).

Of the natural supplements and OTC meds I've tried...

- Ashwagandha made me SO ANGRY as I was trying to go to sleep. I was yelling at myself in my head.

- Valerian made me tense and wired.

- L-theanine powder mixed with iced tea gave a VERY slight lift in mood that lasted about 30 minutes.

- L-tyrosine powder made me feel sick, faint, overheated, extremely tense and wired, and completely out of it.

- Magnesium does nothing at all for my anxiety or sleep.

- Hydroxyzine made me extra awake, tense, wired, irritable and restless.

- Benadryl had the same effect. REALLY agitated. Like I was extra tired but too wired to be sleepy.

- Promethazine (Phenergan) I took this antihistamine every night from age 10 to 25 to help prevent morning Rhinitis, but it never helped me sleep. I have had Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder and Insomnia since early childhood and it made no difference to that. When I tried to stop taking it at 20 though, I couldn't sleep AT ALL so it took me 5 years of on and off trying to get off it.

But a few months ago, I have a terrifying thought that my brothers in danger, or that he'll die somehow.

He's a healthy, strong 25 year old young man, whom I absolutely adore.

He's my best friend, and the #1 person of the top 3 people I love.

And when random things happen like, he gives me a random, small gift my mind goes like ""It's so you'll remember him""

When he doesn't answer his phone I panic, or when he goes out and takes a little longer than usual to answer texts or such, not that he hangs out in sketchy places, but it's an irrational fear that won't go away.

He hooked up with a dude and he told me where he was and let me know when he was safe again. But I was anxious the entire time until I heard back from him. 

Sometimes I'll randomly text him when he's working (he works from home), just to check if he's still alive cause my mind pictures him laying dead on the floor, when I'm out working. 

We're getting tattooed on Monday, together, and I'm getting a tattoo of little drawings him and my other younger brother have made for me. And my mind goes again ""It's so you have something to remember him by"", and I'm thinking about canceling my appointment, cause what if I'm calling it in by doing it? 

I've stopped hugging him cause I feel like that's saying goodbye, I've stopped showing a lot of affection lately. 

I do understand that right now there's no health indicators that could put him in danger, but I don't want him going anywhere outside this house because I'm terrified he won't come back, even if it's just out to the corner to play Pokémon Go. 

Is there anyway I can learn how to cope with this? 

I'm already in therapy if that counts for anything.",1675504235.0

My mother is planning on flying out to stay with her and my grandpa for a while in hopes of comforting her. But here's the thing... This is not the first time my mother has had to stay with them because of my Grandmother's depression and my mother feels quite hopeless sometimes to help.

I don't think people knows how bad it can be and how bad it can consume your life. I haven't once met someone who's experienced health anxiety before so it's really hard for me to really relate with anyone else. It just usually feels like I'm alone in this.

People usually say ""you're never alone"" which is absolute fucking bullshit because whenever you're having a crisis, no one is really there for you at all and you have to basically just drown in your own anxiety all on your own and nobody is really there to comfort you. I haven't had people who I can openly talk to about this sadly which makes it so much harder for me to want to achieve anything in life. 

I used to hear about health anxiety and I never knew how bad that it was. Honestly ever since the pandemic, I've become such a different person in THE worse way possible and I'm still not in the right place mentally due to still feeling a bit mentally unstable even to this day. It's frustrating and honestly sometimes I do wish I had the balls to actually wake myself up a bit in order to take charge all over again because I know for a fact that no one will really help me the way that I can help myself. Somedays I have times when I'm really optimistic and want to improve my life while other times I'm just too tired of everything to want to do anything about my life and my fucked up mental state. 

It really is a battle everyday and you have to keep fighting for yourself so that you don't remain trapped and lost forever because it's so scary to always feel this way.

Like I'm a star in the sky, giving off heat. Like I'm sitting in a sauna (but without the sweating). Like there is a little man living in my body and he has a campfire going and is roasting weenies/marshmallows. I can't think of any other ways of describing this feeling.

It's 75 degrees in here right now so not all that hot but when the AC kicks on or the temp gets down into the 60's, I feel better so perhaps I'm heat-intolerant?. Maybe just anxiety?. It almost feels like a ""I have PMS and feel overheated"" kind of a thing (except I'm a male).

I often take my temperature when I feel like this, expecting it to be 99.5 or even higher and am very surprized when it's only 98.5 or even 97.7 because it feels like I'm burning up inside and have a fever and yet I'm actually ""running cold"". My BP/pulse are normal too.

I do have GAD, Depression, OCD, ADHD and a lot of sinus issues and I do have stress in my life and suffer from pretty severe CPTSD from years of horrible things that have happened since the pandemic.

Anyone else have this heat sensation?. Ibuprofen seems to make it worse. I also have GERD but that doesn't appear to have anything to do with this heat sensation. Bloodwork/oxygen/UA came back normal and no Diabetes or Thyroid issues. Thank you for reading!.",1675306794.0

I relapsed with sh, my anxiety has been so bad that it's causing me persistent chest pain and nausea, and, while they're usually passive, I've been having suicidal thoughts every day for weeks.

The only relief I get is being with my friends. I have two friends I see regularly, and I love them more than anything in the world. I would do anything for them. Spending time with them makes me feel human again, they remind me of what it feels like to be alive. But whenever I'm not with them, and I'm alone, the dopamine withers away and I'm back to being chained to my thoughts, deteriorating with every second. 

My number one issue is that I'm terrified of developing a co-dependent relationship with them. It kills me to be vulnerable the way I am and I don't want to push them away. I already feel like such a burden to them because sometimes i'm so consumed by my mental illness that it's all I can talk about. I need them more than anything right now, but I can't bring myself to text or call them or let them know the extent to which I need them because I don't want them to grow to resent me. No matter what I do, even if I get more stable, I don't think I will ever in my life be able to convince myself that I deserve them. They don't owe me anything, they could leave if it became too much. But if they did, I would have nothing left. If they ever left me, I would die. 

How do I learn how to take care of myself on my own? I don't know who I am anymore. I don't enjoy anything anymore, none of the things I used to be passionate about interest me anymore. I have no motivation, no hobbies, nowhere to go. I am in so much pain.",1675316459.0

slowly sucking away the feeling that my body is my own,

Slowly sucking the life out of me

They’re suffocating, I’m suffocating

I barely notice my heart until it’s about ready to rocket launch out of my chest

It feels so fast and irregular

It’s 10 in the morning and this workday is seeming bigger and longer

And harder to accomplish minute by minute

I feel my sense of pride and my determination to succeed pulling together

The thin threads of what's left of my composure

Questions flood my head of what ifs and what could bes

What may never be and what I am willing to fight for

Would be nice for all of us to get together and actually talk about our experiences. Of course not everyone has to talk because I do get that it's hard for some people to talk about their experiences with anxiety and some do suffer from social anxiety as well which also makes it hard to talk but would be nice to just be there and to not feel so alone all the time. 

Maybe even a Zoom link would have been ideal but I'm not really sure of any Zoom links though. I've searched and no valid results really came up, mostly just random websites lol

I guess discord still exists but I'd like it to feel ""more human"" if that makes sense. I want to see someone's face and hear them speak. Just something less virtual and more real. Because I don't know about  you but just hearing someone talk or see someone's face is equivalent to a big warm cozy hug to me. I feel like if I had that I would feel a lot better to be honest.

I don't know what really triggered me because it could have been sooo many things all at once

Obviously the whole virus did but also there are other things such as me getting my first ever panic attack right in the middle of the goddamn pandemic💀

Horrible time for me because I was trying so hard to connect with people but I didn't really find many people to talk to so I was forced to search for apps. I remember LITERALLY typing ""lonely apps chat"" and ""anxiety vent app"" and I got a few apps which was helpful to me at the time (Still is)

But to this day I'm still somehow feeling extreme anxiety and I'm not talking about the anxiety where you're just ""a little bit anxious"" and then it goes away. No, that's not it at all. It's anxiety where you feel like your whole entire body is constantly Shutting and it's the type of anxiety where you feel like your thoughts are eating you alive every damn minute of everyday. 

I don't know how many ""imaginary symptoms"" I've gotten thanks to anxiety. Its frustrating because I'll get those specific symptoms like one week and then the next week it'll be something completely different. So one article or something I'll see online will usually trigger it and then I'll automatically be convinced that something horrific is happening to me. It's this strange cycle of chaos that I've created for myself and I can't stand it. I'm kinda over it because a part of me really genuinely wants to feel better but I just have no damn clue how to do it.

I've tried talking to people who I'm supposedly ""closest"" to and they never listen because they don't really know what it's like to be me 24/7 and so it's hard for them to grasp what my reality is.

So I've been forced to meet people online who's suffered from health anxiety or who are still currently suffering from health anxiety because I guess that's the only thing I'm really looking for. I'm looking for sweet instant relief from my chaotic mind.",1675258667.0

Or maybe you get a call from your boss telling you that your being laid off. Maybe your getting evicted. It could be anything really.

I was pretty close to being blacked out drunk. I saw this girl and I believe she approached me first. (Some of the details are alittle foggy because it was so long ago and I was so drunk) but anyways I believe she approached me she was very drunk as well. So we started dancing and making out and I was pretty new to going out and drinking so I just wasn’t thinking hey watch yourself. I just thought at this time wow this girl is hot and we’re making out and she is grinding on me. We where really going at it so during that time I grabbed her breast and she turned around and kept kissing me after I grab her breast. She never said no are seemed like she didn’t want me there kissing her and stuff so we continued kissing and grinding. But now I just feel really uncomfortable about the whole thing like she I have not grabbed her breast and stuff. ( also I was never forcefully during this situation I was moving very slow) so does that count as sexual assault like maybe she didn’t want me to grab her breast are something. 

Ok now there is another experience with a different girl. Same scenario I was drunk borderline blacked out again. (I know very stupid) but anyways me and this girl where hitting it off. And she seemed to be pretty sober at least a lot more then I was. ( I even remember when we where talking I told myself in my head to stop talking because I was slurry my speech so bad) anyways she asked if I wanted to go outside I agreed so we talked for alittle bit but I wanted to get back to my friend. So as I was leaving I remember I really wanted to kiss this girl. So I asked can I give you a kiss and she said yes. This is where it gets bad. The best I remember is she said yes then turned her cheek towards me but I wanted to kiss her on the lips so I went for the mouth instead I believe I even used tongue. Looking back it just felt wrong like I gave into my desire and just went it to get what I wanted. I didn’t grab her are pull her close but I came in really hot on the kiss. Anyways after the kiss she said oh I meant in the cheek. 

So does this make me a creep did I comment sexual assault I’ve never done anything inappropriate like this before in fact I was really on the other side of the fence and really made sure everyone felt ok every second in any kissing are sexual times.",1675236035.0

My parents divorced when I was about 10 or so and I was used in the child support battle. My dad believed his new wife at the time that I didn't love him and he kicked me out at 16 to go live with my mother. My family ties were definitely not good after that and still aren't too this day. I've had to have my mother arrested for assaulting me while pregnant so she isn't in my life anymore...my dad is there but that's also a touchy subject because he doesn't approve of my life choices. I've told him that not being in my life for 14+ years (I'm 30 now)  doesn't mean you have a say anymore but you can have an opinion. I've also never admitted to my father that he abandoned me a long time ago and it still haunts me. 

Now fast forward to my daughter who is about to turn 1. My boyfriend and I were kicked out of his parents house right before Xmas because his mother is a nasty drunk. Now we live in a hotel trying to make it and I feel my mental illness has completely taken over my brain. My boyfriend loves me but he's told me a few times lately that he's about to take the dog, our daughter and leave because I'm unfit with my issues and shutting him out which I honestly don't mean to do. He works overnights when I work days and I suppose I haven't been making it easier for him when i dont do much to keep things clean which I'm truely trying to work on. I know I need to get professional help but making a phone call is such a dread for me and my insurance is about to run out which definitely isn't going to help me...I just can't take feeling like I'm an unfit parent when I know deep down I'm not because I always make sure she has what she needs and she's a happy, healthy baby girl....

Suppose I just need some others to talk to that can relate to these problems because talking to my boyfriend I just shut down and not say anything which isn't healthy and pisses him off. I also have caught myself disassociating myself and agreeing to what he said to me without even hearing what he said and then asking a question a few minutes later about what he just told me which really grinds his gears....I don't mean to...I really don't and I don't know why I do it.",1675230726.0

As I'm typing this out it could end up turning into a long story.
So, around 11/12 years back now, I ended up being in a particular YouTube video (nothing ""bad"" btw! Just online and acting stupid raging on a game, etc...) but eventually the guy who I was raging at during a game of COD, ended up recording and making a video of it and putting it online. Now, I recognise there are hundreds or thousands of these types of videos, but now, as an adult, it still bothers me that it's up there and there's nothing I can do about it (I'll be honest, a few years back I did think about suicide over it), people who I know who saw it at the time said it was ""bad"", just funny. And I think if I watched it, I'd say the same in all honesty.
So, onto this one particular person now. Throughout the years there has probably been about 6 or 7 people that I know that knew it was me through a combination of the online gamertag esentially, 99% of them are fine, laughed at the time etc... but that's about it and I still speak to most of them to this day. However, there is one of that 7 in particular that is NOT one to be trusted in this matter, he's the type that could turn one day and end up putting a screenshot of my face online and tagging the video or something, it could be anything, but I've never ever trusted the guy at all! But, he's one that you need to keep in your ""good books"" if that makes sense, so keep him onside and speak to him, still go online with him etc... all that essentially just to make sure that he wouldn't do anything like that! In the plainest of terms, I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him, pretty big snake, scumbag, never worked, 30 years of age and sits at home in his parents and does nothing! This knowing me and all this that happened 11/12 years back is a ""big deal"" for him if that makes sense. I know this isn't anyway to live your life, in constant fear of this one person and wondering if they'll wake up one day and do whatever potentially online. 
Now it all changed about 7 months ago, one day, a sports team he was following lost, I messaged him about half an hour later to say ""that was a crazy game"" etc... he totally switched and said ""time to start posting this everywhere again now"". To which gave me essentially a full on panic attack, my heart out my chest, beating as fast as I've ever experienced before. And I went into a state of a very low depression and anxiety. So I ended up blocking him about a week later after he did that, I tried to explain how it made me feel, I knew what the response would be, but essentially, he didn't give a shit, like he ever did to begin with anyway. There was only one reason ever why he carried on messaging me all these years. Anyway, to this day I haven't WhatsApp'd him or been online with him again, but! He's still to this day, messaging me on PSN...""COD?""...""When are you coming back on?""...""COD?""...""When are you back?...""Why have you gone?"". This was about 3 months after I just left the PlayStation alone for that period to (see I didn't want to block him either just incase) and I went back on after that period and saw all these messages like the ones above, with no replies from me for that period to, still messaging though everyother day! Hopefully at this point you can see where I'm coming from, you need to ""humour"" (don't know if that's the right word) or ""entertain"" these people into thinking you still want to be around them just to make sure they don't do anything. So after those 3 months, my anxiety gave in and I messaged him back on PSN just saying a one line general response to his 50+ messages and to this day he's still messaging me on it. I NEED some advice on what to do here! I know this is no way to live your life, and I have a house and a job I've worked my life to get to as well (architect) and I don't want this in the back of my head for the rest of it. I think I'm at the stage now where I need some help on what to do with someone like this. I'm thinking about just leaving the PSN account and that will be the last pathway that he has to communicate with me. Effectively cutting him off then, it's just the fear in the back of my mind then that will come from it but I'm wondering if it's just something I need to do anyway?
Again, this type of person is NOT someone that would be open to a normal conversation, he's your classic scumbag, as selfish as you can get in life, doesn't care, zero empathy to any other person in life etc...

So I'm wondering what you all would do or what your advice would be for me.

She suggested that there might be some attention-deficit/anxiety/depression-related things going on and that an SSRI may help even if it’s temporary to balance my brain chemicals. Unfortunately, I can’t get into my PCP until the end of March. Does anyone have any suggestions to access medication sooner and affordably?

think no job except working for my parents once in a while (I’m able to nap in the office bc I feel exhausted often), I don’t leave the house alone, I struggle to keep contact with friends, I’ve not put on a clothes washing in three(ish?) months etc etc. 

anyway, possibly unnecessary backstory aside, I’m constantly in a high state of near-panic and little things can put me a liiiittle too close to the edge. I’ll start spiralling at stupid stuff like my twin (22m) pretending to be dead. That’s what this posts about:P

Even though he pranks me like this often, within about two seconds of him not responding, I’ll be anxiously thinking about the fact that this time could be real. I can’t seem to just let that be and allow probability on my side. I’m always stressing right away. I shouldn’t let it affect me this much but I feel like it just causes an unnecessary spike in my cortisol for his entertainment. I know it’s funny to others but I’m fed up because my boyfriend is starting to do it too. I feel really guilty trying to ignore it just in case but I realise I have to so it can stop being fun. 

Side note that I feel my brain catches up to my my body’s chemical reaction rather than my brain being in charge- being able to identify such a situation by itself and only then creating the appropriate response. 

Sorry for the disjointed ramble! & thankyou for creating a safe space to vent<3

I finally built up the courage to tell my parents, although it really has been giving me huge anxiety attacks because I was scared about their reactions, and I told one of my parents about it, and they told me that I need to get a brain scan and do all these things such as work out more, live healthier, and eat less sugar in order to get better.

They also want me to go to the Amen clinics, although I read here that it was a total scam. I convinced her that I wont get a brain scan, as I don't feel like I want to do that, and so I may only be talking to one of their psychiatrists instead via zoom. 

What I need advice on is, How do I tell my parents how hard it is to do all those things such as living healthier and being super positive all the time when its really hard to do so when I'm so anxious all the time.

The other day I was ok and able to retrieve the pills that fell, but today they fell into the sink there was no way I was going to retrieve them.

Would it be ok to try to take my dose again seeing none of it went into my body or should I just skip today? ( my throat is sore now)
If I'm feeling somewhat better could I just take another clonapin I use as my as needed pill, when I have anxiety.

# 

i self diagnose with orthorexia, after not being able to go out with friends anymore, losing friends and losing relationships with all of my family, plus not going out to eat with my family anymore and just developing a very elitist view on diet.

I saw a lot of stuff as toxic poison and I started to become a bit unhinged. I never reached out for help with it but I have other things in my life I was in therapy for like depression and anxiety. Plus some schizophrenic stuff. Thought I'd share I guess and wanted to know what you think of orthorexia, I grew up in America and basically saw the commercials of a starving african kid, I thought that it was my fault he was so thin and that the food I ate was causing his country to be very poor or full of slavery.

I still cant really do any of the stuff above but I've isolated myself in my room and not ate for a day and my mom noticed last year then brought me some canned soup, which I ate right away because I haven't not eaten for an entire day since I was a kid. I know that fasting is pretty good for people too but I dont think I was even drinking water. I got really paranoid about tap water and I think that's also orthorexia based, since I thought it wasn't healthy water.

What makes me feel safe is that there is some good food out there, that I would not be directly damaging a whole entire village and children from another area for eating. For example, I used to go pick chicken of the woods nearby my apartment in a kind of woodsy area and I ate that on the stove with some butter. Chicken of the woods is pretty good for you.

As I'm typing this out it could end up turning into a long story.
So, around 11/12 years back now, I ended up being in a particular YouTube video (nothing ""bad"" btw! Just online and acting stupid raging on a game, etc...) but eventually the guy who I was raging at during a game of COD, ended up recording and making a video of it and putting it online. Now, I recognise there are hundreds or thousands of these types of videos, but now, as an adult, it still bothers me that it's up there and there's nothing I can do about it (I'll be honest, a few years back I did think about suicide over it), people who I know who saw it at the time said it was ""bad"", just funny. And I think if I watched it, I'd say the same in all honesty.
So, onto this one particular person now. Throughout the years there has probably been about 6 or 7 people that I know that knew it was me through a combination of the online gamertag esentially, 99% of them are fine, laughed at the time etc... but that's about it and I still speak to most of them to this day. However, there is one of that 7 in particular that is NOT one to be trusted in this matter, he's the type that could turn one day and end up putting a screenshot of my face online and tagging the video or something, it could be anything, but I've never ever trusted the guy at all! But, he's one that you need to keep in your ""good books"" if that makes sense, so keep him onside and speak to him, still go online with him etc... all that essentially just to make sure that he wouldn't do anything like that! In the plainest of terms, I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him, pretty big snake, scumbag, never worked, 30 years of age and sits at home in his parents and does nothing! This knowing me and all this that happened 11/12 years back is a ""big deal"" for him if that makes sense. I know this isn't anyway to live your life, in constant fear of this one person and wondering if they'll wake up one day and do whatever potentially online. 
Now it all changed about 7 months ago, one day, a sports team he was following lost, I messaged him about half an hour later to say ""that was a crazy game"" etc... he totally switched and said ""time to start posting this everywhere again now"". To which gave me essentially a full on panic attack, my heart out my chest, beating as fast as I've ever experienced before. And I went into a state of a very low depression and anxiety. So I ended up blocking him about a week later after he did that, I tried to explain how it made me feel, I knew what the response would be, but essentially, he didn't give a shit, like he ever did to begin with anyway. There was only one reason ever why he carried on messaging me all these years. Anyway, to this day I haven't WhatsApp'd him or been online with him again, but! He's still to this day, messaging me on PSN...""COD?""...""When are you coming back on?""...""COD?""...""When are you back?...""Why have you gone?"". This was about 3 months after I just left the PlayStation alone for that period to (see I didn't want to block him either just incase) and I went back on after that period and saw all these messages like the ones above, with no replies from me for that period to, still messaging though everyother day! Hopefully at this point you can see where I'm coming from, you need to ""humour"" (don't know if that's the right word) or ""entertain"" these people into thinking you still want to be around them just to make sure they don't do anything. So after those 3 months, my anxiety gave in and I messaged him back on PSN just saying a one line general response to his 50+ messages and to this day he's still messaging me on it. I NEED some advice on what to do here! I know this is no way to live your life, and I have a house and a job I've worked my life to get to as well (architect) and I don't want this in the back of my head for the rest of it. I think I'm at the stage now where I need some help on what to do with someone like this. I'm thinking about just leaving the PSN account and that will be the last pathway that he has to communicate with me. Effectively cutting him off then, it's just the fear in the back of my mind then that will come from it but I'm wondering if it's just something I need to do anyway?
Again, this type of person is NOT someone that would be open to a normal conversation, he's your classic scumbag, as selfish as you can get in life, doesn't care, zero empathy to any other person in life etc...

So I'm wondering what you all would do or what your advice would be for me.

With time, effort and practice, we can make the most of each day to live our best lives.

These practices help us leave the past behind and live in the present:

**Accept the past.** Events have already happened. We can’t undo them. We can’t wish them away – that’s just physics! Now is the best time to acknowledge them, learn whatever can be learned from them and apply that learning to the present.    
  

**Recognize that your past doesn’t need to define you.**  Thinking that the future will automatically be the same as the past is a common limiting belief which we can challenge. Situations themselves do not define us – how we choose to respond to them does.  
 

**Let go.** Sometimes easier said than done but entirely do-able. I guide most of my clients through a ‘letting go’ process which they can use whenever they wish thereafter.  
 

**Take a look at your present life.** Taking stock of your health, family, relationships, home, personal development, career, leisure etc (in terms of whatever these things mean to you) provides a starting point.  
 

**Create the life you want.** For each of these areas, decide how you would prefer them to be.

**Immerse yourself in each moment.** You’ve probably experienced the frustration and irritation of being involved in one activity while you’re actually thinking about something else. Develop the habit of asking yourself what is the most valuable thing you could be doing right now to progress towards one of your visions for the future.  
 

**Check in with your emotions.** Reflect on how you feel. Are you energized? Is your mood melancholy? How do you feel about what you’re doing right now? Explore what you are learning from your reflections.  
   
 

**When you live in the present, doing what is most valuable to you, reflecting and learning, you will be on your way to living your best life.**",1674925371.0

347,I am desperately not ok,6,10mjow1,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/10mjow1/i_am_desperately_not_ok/,14,"This is my first post here and I’m not sure how many people are going to see it or how many people will relate but here goes.

TW* Contains talk of sexual trauma and suicide.

I’m a 39 year old male with no friends that spends all of my time alone in a room at home. I have been diagnosed with severe depression and anxiety and have tried 4-5 different antidepressants none of which have had any effect on my condition.

The root cause of my depression is erectile dysfunction. From as far back as I can remember, from my first sexual experience with a female, I was 19 I think, I couldn’t maintain my erection. This led me to be wholly ashamed and embarrassed and led to me not wanting to have another sexual encounter again.

About a year later I met somebody new and we started to have sex, again my ED showed up and while I could sometimes maintain it long enough to climax I would also lose it often. I ended up getting her pregnant and having a son. We separated when he was about 6 months old and it led to 15 or so years of a very abusive relationship where she would psychologically abuse me through text messages and use my son against me as weapon.

My confidence was already rock bottom due to the ED, and in the years since I have had a few sexual experiences with other women but they have all ended the same way, with me not being able to get or maintain an erection.

The trauma of this has led me to become a shut in that never leaves my house, and turned to food for comfort, so I’m now massively overweight, almost 300lbs. 

It’s hard to have friends because they always ask me about girls and I obviously can’t disclose my ED to them because that would just be horrendous, I’ve already felt enough ridicule and embarrassment. So whatever friends I do make I just end up losing because I eventually push them away.

Living like this has caused me to become profoundly depressed, to the point where I can barely function, I never clean my house or myself  for that matter. It has also caused me to become extremely anxious, scared of everything. I just wish I could be normal and live a normal fulfilling life. 

I think about killing myself a lot, but the truth is I’m too much of a coward to do it even though I know it will end my suffering. I also don’t want to put that pain on my son and my sister/nephews/niece.

I’ve tried pills for my ED but they didn’t work, I feel like I’m not a real man and no woman wants a sexless relationship, unless they’re asexual, but the problem is my depression is so deep and severe that nobody would want to be with somebody who’s that down and apathetic.

Therapy is expensive and I lost my job last year, I’ve been surviving on my redundancy money, but that will soon run out, and I’m really struggling to pick myself up and get a job. I hated my last job so that no doubt played a part in my depression also.

I know it was a long piece, if you made it to the end thank you. I don’t have anyone to talk to, this is the only place I could post this with anonymity.",1674822734.0
348,Zoloft never again!,1,10mqkqb,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/10mqkqb/zoloft_never_again/,0,"

Hi yall. For a long period of time, i was suffering from GAD and hyponcondria (about 6 months). I was using 125 mg zoloft every morning to help me come through the day. But my days were usually inside the house and sometimes very rarely outside the house for a short period. My heart rate was allways high. At rest between 90-110 and from normal walk around the house up to 150. So i felt handicapped and was at the doctor all the time to check my heart with ekg's etc etc. With other words, my life was 0 quality.

UNTIL! I changed zoloft out for duloxetine. I dont know where to start. First off, i fell less anxious in general. Second is my motivation to live and achieve things sky rocket. My heart rate got down to a normal 65-85 at rest, and I also went out for a 5 km run today where my heart rate was between 120-135. Also i notice a change in my mood. I am more happy and cant stop myself from smiling out of nowhere sometimes. I wanted to share my story so far (14 days with duloxetine so far)  to maybe motivate you guys to not give up! I know it is hard and I was there myself just a couple of weeks earlier. But there is a light at the end of the tunel! I am very sure that you also can reach that! 


I am aware of that not everyone responds to the same medicine equally but if some of you uses zoloft (sertraline) without and huge effect it is worth talking with your doc about changing them for duloxetine or something else.

My Grandma passed away on Monday morning at 95. I was very close to her, and I decided to take point on her funeral, as a way to honor her.

Unfortunately, it's a Catholic funeral. and I haven't ""been"" Catholic since I was 18. I grew up Catholic, so I still remember the basic stuff, but the problem is with my family. No one else is helping with this, everything I do is second guessed and wrong. I'm falling apart not because of the responsibility I have to Grandma, but because of a person wasn't put in the obituary, or a niece isn't the ""right"" pick to do something in the funeral service.

&#x200B;

THEN comes today, where my sister decided to go off. She has bipolar, so I was expecting it. Don't take that as shade on people with bipolar, I just know my sisters' patterns, and whenever she's having an episode, she attacks me. The short of it is, to quote her, ""Don't contact me again unless it involves Dad. Once Dad dies, I'm washing my hands of you.""

&#x200B;

IDK why, but I feel... broken. Not that I wanted a close relationship, we haven't been close since we were kids. But with everything going on, the funeral, the trying to make it right for Grandma, and now this, I'm just empty inside.

354,I Have Anxiety,7,10m816j,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/10m816j/i_have_anxiety/,0,"Hey everyone, today I am going to be sharing with you a little more about myself and my anxiety. I have had anxiety for quite a while now and I want to continue keeping my videos personal and covering deep details that aren't talked about enough regarding mental health.

If you resonate with what I talk about here please consider subscribing to my YouTube channel for videos about topics like this.

Let’s start off with the basics. What type of anxiety do I have? Am I diagnosed? How long have I been struggling with it? 

So, I have Generalized Anxiety Disorder, or G.A.D. for short. Yes, I was diagnosed by my doctor and I have been struggling with this mental health disorder for almost 8 years now. It really started to affect my daily life after I experienced my first panic attack back in Grade 11. I made a video about that day which I will link in this video.

Essentially, Generalized Anxiety Disorder is the aspect of anxiety–worrying intensely about uncertainties in the future–combined with the breadth of its reach, touching all aspects of life that someone without G.A.D. would not view as worrisome, hence the “generalized” part of the name.

The Anxiety and Depression Association of America says, “Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is characterized by persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things. People with GAD may anticipate disaster and may be overly concerned about money, health, family, work, or other issues. Individuals with GAD find it difficult to control their worry. They may worry more than seems warranted about actual events or may expect the worst even when there is no apparent reason for concern.”

That really hits the nail on the head; my anxiety is exactly that, worrying about general things in life. I have anxiety towards eating, traveling, socialization, safety, being alone, world-ending events, horror movies, people getting sick, and so much more. 

As simple as this sounds, Generalized Anxiety Disorder is just like any other anxiety disorder with the exception of what areas in life it affects. Someone with Social Anxiety Disorder may only get extremely anxious specifically towards social settings whereas I do fine in a lot of social situations but a lot of generic things in life can cause me severe anxiety. I won’t go into too much detail about G.A.D. specifically because that requires its own video which I plan to do in the near future.

Now, one thing I would be wondering at this point if I were watching this 8 years ago when I was just learning about anxiety, what it all meant, and the fact that I was experiencing it everyday, is whether I’m ashamed of it or not. Am I embarrassed by it? Does it affect my self-esteem?

And my answer to that varies; if you were to ask me whether I was ashamed and embarrassed because of my anxiety 6 years ago, the answer would have absolutely been “yes.” I’ve been learning about anxiety and mental health constantly over the past 8 years and during the first few years I was experiencing it was when I had the largest amount of new information coming at me from all directions.

I was very much in the dark, I didn’t know what panic attacks were, I didn’t understand anxiety, I thought meditation was weird, and I didn’t know a lot about anxiety disorders. All I knew was that I couldn’t stay in my physics classroom but I was alright in the other ones, I couldn’t eat in public anymore, getting a ride home from anyone except my parents made me extremely anxious, and there were so many social situations like field trips, sports, and parties that I had to pass up all because of this thing inside my head that I didn’t understand and couldn’t control.

It made me extremely embarrassed. I was constantly making up excuses for why I couldn’t do something in order to avoid telling people it was because of my anxiety. And when I wasn’t telling people excuses I was brainstorming constantly to come up with semi-believable new ones.

I was quietly ashamed of myself and had low self-esteem because at the end of the day I knew that I was the one doing this to myself, or so I thought. While it is technically true that it was my own brain causing these issues, I took that to heart and was ignoring or ignorant to the fact that I had a disorder that was causing me to lose control of the situation.

So I blamed myself when I couldn’t go on a school trip or go out to a restaurant with friends. I just saw it as my own mind being stupid and useless, and I would think of myself as pathetic. It’s a very easy and slippery slope to fall down when going through any struggles with our mental health.

However, if you were to ask me those same questions today I would have a completely different answer. I have completely turned around my entire view on my life and who I am with this disorder. I take pride in who I am and I use it as a tool to connect with others and provide help where I can rather than letting it eat away at my self-esteem.

Are there times when I have a panic attack or my anxiety stops me from doing a simple task one day and I just feel stupid and beat myself up? Yes, we all have those moments of frustration when our emotions are running hot. But do I feel that way for weeks or months? No. I pick myself back up and keep working on improving my mental health.

I’ve learned so much about my anxiety, how my mind functions, and mental health in general. I’ve gained new insight about life like how utterly vital our mindset is at any given moment in life and that, as Randy Pausch brilliantly stated, “we cannot change the cards we are dealt, just how we play the hand.”

So now I use the experience and time I’ve gained with my mental health struggles and success in life to provide some insight and connection with people who are in the same position I was when I was first experiencing anxiety, very confused and scared. As well as people who are more experienced with it like I am. 

I see it as an integral part of my character and one of the largest factors that made me who I have become and who I continue to grow into. Honestly, as much pain and suffering I have been through and continue to experience, I would never erase it from my life if given the chance.

That’s a little bit about me and my anxiety. This, of course, is just the tip of the iceberg and I will be sharing plenty more of my experiences on my YouTube Channel which can be found in my bio. I hope this was of some value to you.",1674781588.0

I have also tried wellbutrin in the past but that med made my anxiety worse and crazy mood swings. I have tried prozac and Zoloft in the past when I was elementary-high school and was on those for years but they eventually just stopped working after I was at the highest dose for awhile. I have also tried Venlafexine which made me feel horrible- best way to describe it, I felt like a zombie and not real and would need to sleep the whole day. I’ve been on propranolol to help anxiety symptoms but I ended up having side effects that made taking the med just not so great so I stopped that. 

I am curious how other people have done on Duloxetine after not having success with other meds. I know everyone’s brain is different, but I would love to hear any good or bad things about it and any side effects to look out for. My anxiety has been uncontrollable recently and using lorazepam for panic attacks. With the increased anxiety I’ve had lately, it’s made my depression worse because I feel like I can’t do anything anymore, and can’t find joy in anything. Morning anxiety has always been the worst for me. To the point I had to reduce my work hours and only work afternoon shift. I’m wondering if taking duloxetine at night time would help kick in overnight and maybe help my morning anxiety better? My med provider also said after we check in after a month on duloxetine that we can see if we need to do 2x a day taking duloxetine. 

I am also in the process of getting evaluated and approved to receive ketamine therapy. Anyone else tried this? I know it can be amazing for some people and some don’t always get a ton of relief. I’m hoping it could help me with my brain being more resistant depression meds. I read up that it can be amazing treatment for depression but that some people don’t get much relief from anxiety. I’d love to hear any of your experiences, thoughts, or advice on anything I mentioned. I can also ask for this advice in r/ketaminetherapy but figured I’d just add it in here too.

Hi everyone, Im new to reddit but I wanted some opinions on the current situation.

I am a 27 year old female and I have taken Paxil since I was 14. Had 2 relapses in between where just increasing dosage helped. I bought my own house in August this year and moved out of my parents there on my own (in the same city, only 15 mins way). The first 3 months I had no issues, I was a little anxious to move at first but who isn't. Then in mid November it just hit me. I took in a foster dog (which didn't get along with my current pets) and that really stressed me out (I think this was my trigger). At first it was just anxiety over the foster but once I got rid of it that didn't help my anxiety. My sister had to come stay with me cause I didn't want to be anxious and alone. Tried fighting it on my own for 3 weeks before talking to my doctor about increasing my meds. I increased my meds with no help (after 5 weeks, actually made me a bit worse). My doctor has now decided to switch my medication to Effexor. We are doing a slow switch which will take about a month. I am just worried that I wont want to live at my current house anymore, even though I love the house I'm having a lot of anxiety over the future there (never before this relapse did I worry about the future so much). Maybe I cant handle living alone Im not sure, but I dont want to move back in with my parents.

Have any of you had good experiences with Effexor? How long does it usually take to work? Is this worry about the future because I moved out or because of my relapse?

Thanks :)",1674574449.0

after all these negative experiences with brightside, i’d like to explore other virtual mail-order psychiatrist services similar to brightside that are more stable. what are some good alternatives to brightside that take unitedhealthcare, prescribe wellbutrin and hydroxyzine (NOT just SSRIs, they don’t work for me), and work well for college students who move around a lot?",1674577636.0

I should also note that I'm an introverted homebody who is perfectly comfortable with my own company (and my partner's, who already WFHs).


Something I've noticed over the years is that my anxiety and depression are always worst in the mornings. This also causes me to feel physically sick with (nausea, IBS symptoms) which makes it an absolute nightmare to get out the door on time some mornings. I just feel like I spend the majority of my week, dreading mornings, and counting the minutes until Friday afternoon. This has taken a toll on my mental and physical health, and it's also wreaking havoc on my relationships. I feel like a zombie. 


I've tried getting up earlier, but the earlier I get up the more nauseous I feel (even if I go to bed earlier). I truly have never been a ""morning person"" despite trying for years. I also seem to be my most productive in the afternoon and evenings, even late at night. I just feel like my body and mind are wired differently. 


One thing I really think could help me is the ability to WFH, or at least some sort of flex/hybrid schedule. If I could wear comfortable clothes and have the convenience of my own bathroom and kitchen, I would be more at ease and productive. I also wouldn't have the distraction of my coworkers. 


I work in the digital media/tech/design world, so I feel like WFH is somewhat of a realistic goal. However, all of the positions for these roles seem super competitive. I'm planning to talk with a career counselor soon.

She used an example of a church friend who loved to start drama with other people and then would say ""I can't help it, I'm depressed! How dare you!"" 

I am shocked she has said this because if anything she told me she noticed a difference in me since starting medication where I seemed calmer and happier.

I've made some improvements, in hacking my environment so I can still keep things going on a very basic level, . Then there's the overeating. The funny thing is I love to eat healthy.

Interestingly, the year I left my job, I lost about 30 lbs without even thinking about it. Didn't even work out. I often refer to my current weight range as my ""normal stress weight"" lol.

So I’m not going too far back into when things started as I will be here all day. 

So every two weeks or so I get these cycles of intense DPDR, feeling out of whack, uncontrollable thoughts, bizarre thinking patterns, constantly watching myself, anxiety and all the symptoms, depression, loss of motivation, watching my speech, sensory issues such as touch and hearing feel out of whack, brain fog, feeling hopeless and lost, stiff neck, feeling generally unwell, sneezing fits, visual snow, eye floaters, cold hands and feet, memory loss, poor concentration. Unable to picture myself or who or what I am.

I have it all the time but some symptoms subside every 2 weeks or so and can tolerate some of it but it’s always there.

I work with my doctor but doesn’t help much. Only thing that came up from blood work was low ferritin I tried supps but anxiety was work and I struggle to tolerate high iron foods. 

I have a psychiatrist and he’s stumped but has mentioned a few things. Treatment resistant depression, personality disorder, bipolar, anxiety. So I’ve tried countless meds short term and felt 1000% worse. I’ve done a saliva test to determine what meds I can tolerate going forward. 

I’m also working with a neurologist and had many scans, tests. I’ve got an EEG this Tuesday to rule out absent seizures. Condition’s mentioned was Post vax Covid syndrome, FND. If results come back normal then see a neurophysiologist to help with FND if it is this.

Docs aren’t 100% so I’m always sat here worrying more cos I don’t know what’s wrong with me. It’s been 2 years since feeling normal. I’ve also tried lots of natural remedies to try shift things and doesn’t help much or makes things worse.

There was that time, when we would flip each other off sometimes, and just laugh about it (he started it btw). But the way he would react to that was kinda like ""yeah yeah sure, it was your turn"". Like, maybe it was just in my head (it was quite cringe for me to do that) but he seemed to be so lost and embarrassed to get it back from me. Basically, to a lot of things he reacts with nodding.

Anything from stress, confrontation, worrying about family members health, small normal disagreements with spouse, daughter being extra whiny, etc can literally cause me to shut down and feel like I'm losing control. I'm not at all suicidal, but during those moments I do have a small thought of what's the point of life anymore if everything's this difficult and I hate myself for it. 

The thing that gets me is that there are people out there everyday who lose their parents, lose their kids or spouse, going through a divorce, working multiple jobs to make ends meet, and I'm over here shutting down because my body cannot handle the normal everyday stresses of life.

393,is the problem my intolerance? or is my intolerance well reasoned?,2,10hgulq,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/10hgulq/is_the_problem_my_intolerance_or_is_my/,3,"for context i am diagnosed with social anxiety & depression and medicated

hello. i have pondered this question for years. am i just normal and intolerant of a normal human experience? do my problems arrive from my disapproval of experiencing a normal thing or is our experience actually different? is the goal to be tolerant or to achieve mental satisfaction? do those go hand in hand? 

i just talked with someone and they said that my issues sound super normal and relatable, and i did not feel great hearing that. to me that makes me feel more hopeless, not relieved. 

i should not base my judgement from one discussion but it has definitely formed food for thought and i want to know if this inner debate is a mostly universal thing for people diagnosed with a mental illness. 

when i look at it from the perspective of the reader, it seems to be a common thing for people to feel like their illness isn’t valid, but is that feeling right? 

i think it comes down to the idea i ponder that people just figured out how to live their life with this and that those who are diagnosed are just people who are intolerant of something normal.

please share thoughts. i know that i am missing pieces to this you could potentially add",1674269580.0

I was talking to my mother about how I was feeling, why I could not go and she was being an ,,okay’’ listener I guess, even though she knows whatever’s wrong with me and i was diagnosed two years ago she still acts like all of the simple shit that I cannot do is because of my laziness. I mentioned to her that in the past, few months ago I have found an article about my disorder written by a psychiatrist which I then asked her to read and she never did. She said she does not even remember me telling her any of this so then I said to her do you want me to read it to you then? I have it saved somewhere in my phone, she said okay and I started looking. I only wanted her to read about my disorder so she could understand me better, so she could understand why I am the way I am. so she would not get mad at me for such things that are hard for me to do. I found the article and started reading to her, I had too much anxiety as always, I was shaking, at that time I have had been crying for like hours so my voice was shaky and I could barely see though my tears. I was explaining to her about the things that I feel. While reading it to her, was giving her some examples so she could understand what i meant better. I  explained to her how important it  is for me, if she could try to understand me I just wanted her to believe me and stop taking my disorder sarcastically, to stop blaming me for having it. I explained to her how important it would have been for me if the people who cared about me would understand my situation, understand a little more about my mental disorder, about how much I am struggling to stay alive and how hard it is for me sometimes. As I was reading she was changing the channels on TV I just said to her if she could turn the volume down a little, because I felt like she was not paying enough attention, so she did. She was being a sassy bitch about it all and even tho she did said she was understanding most of it she made some negative comments about me as well. She was like seeee it says you need to be eating healthy I was thinking dude is that all that you are getting out of this? did you not hear the part where I am struggling not to kill myself? Moreover, I was reading it to her for about 15 minutes she put on a movie and then went ugh can you stop reading this to me? I am too lazy to listen to this, send it to me and i will read it later… so yeah she said that after I truly tried to explain to her how much it would mean to me if she knew what i was going through, what I was feeling. I just stopped talking I did not want to get into a fight or to make her feel bad for not caring enough or some shit so I just left her alone. Had a manic episode in my bathroom you know how it goes trying to stay alive while crying, panicking, making screaming faces at yourself in the mirror like an insane person.

400,Can you help me please? :(,4,10g9dmn,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/10g9dmn/can_you_help_me_please/,0,"Hello reddit community.
I'm 32 (even if I feel like I'm in my early to mid 20's somehow) and I struggle with my mental health for years now. I didn't go to a therapist for many years because I was afraid. In the beginning of 2021 I finally got one (also because I had to, cause I'm trans) and I feel my depression got worse since then. 

First of all: I am an incredibly insecure person. 
I was always and still am convinced that I was lying to myself about having mental health issues, that I'm just lazy, just weird etc. As I discovered that I was trans (which was around 28) I didn't want it to be true and it took a loooot of effort for my friends and myself to calm me down and acknowledge that it's not the end of the world. After that, I was kinda confident in who I am. So I started taking testosterone in August '21. It was scary at first, but then it was fine. Anyways, I have that feeling, that my depression and anxiety got way worse the last year. I can't tell how or why, but now I'm doubting everything: am I really trans?

 He/him pronouns sound unfitting for who I am (not always, but sometimes), she/her is a lot worse! But I don't feel like I am non-binary either. To be honest, I would just like to not exist at all. I would like these thoughts to stop. I feel like I don't like all the typical manly things and am not man enough, but more like an imposter. But I also don't want my old name back, that just sounds like a whole other person and incredibly unfitting for me. But what if I make a mistake by transitioning either? I would just wish to be secure in one thing again.

 I also feel like I don't have depression at all, cause hey, there are nights that I can sleep perfectly, you know? And depressed people have problems with sleeping. What if I have something way worse than that? I guess I also am afraid, that I could have something that can't be healed or can't get better at least. Cause it already feels unbearable already.
My therapist got me meds that I should take, but I'm deeply afraid to take them, cause I don't want to feel numb or like a robot all the time. So I just take a soft herbal one, that is obv not enough. 
I also don't work at the moment, because I simply can't and my therapist also says that it would be good, that I get better before working again. Cause I'm overwhelmed by daily life alone rn. 

The next big thing that lays heavy on my heart is the love topic.
I know my boyfriend for about 4 years now and we have been best friends before getting together in April '21. The last few months I recognized, that I sometimes looked at him and couldn't feel love at all and that makes me feel insanely horrible. I can't feel love for the person I was so freaking deeply in love with when we got together just about a year ago. How is that possible? I also recognize thoughts of ""wouldn't it be funnier with someone else?"" And I hate it. I also have phases where I am super s**ually active and then also feel weird and kinda bad afterwards and then phases like rn where I am s**ually...repulsed?
 Like...I don't want to hear people talking about it or being kissed on the neck or else I feel like something's taking my breath away. That doesn't seem normal at ALL. But what can I do against it? What is with me? 

I forget to mention, that I have to live with him and his roommate since December 21 now, cause I had to leave my old flat and couldn't find a new one. So him and I have to share a bedroom and since he's a university student rn, we nearly spent 24/7 together. Not really 24/7, but you know what I mean. I'm also afraid to be alone, but I always tell him, he can do what he wants and I'm trying to not to hold him back from anything. But anyways, it's not what I wanted, I really feel I need to live alone for some time to learn how to have space for myself and take care of myself alone and just being independent. Cause the least thing I want to be is co-dependant. 

I was like that in an ex-relationship and I am deeply afraid to fall back to that again. I also compare my boyfriend with ex-partners unwillingly again and again. Even if it's a facial expression or how we are as a couple or whatever. And I hate it. I don't even know why I'm doing that. I guess I'm just deeply afraid to have an unhealthy relationship again and being stuck again. 

I talk to my boyfriend a lot about all those things and though he's super supportive, I know that I'm obv hurting him, and that's the least I want to do. 
What can I do to get rid of the anxiety to take my meds and how to stop doubting if I have a mental illness or not? 
I don't want to feel like that my whole life. 
How can I feel love for my partner again, that I want a future with? 
How can it be that my mental health got worse when I'm already in therapy?
Do you guys have some advices for me? Or books, workbooks, exercises? I'm open to everything that could help me in any way!

Thank you a lot! 🌈",1674153332.0

In order to keep creating and advocating I need people to see it. Thank you so much for taking the time to read it!

Hi! I'm Madison and I am someone who lives with OCD. Not obsessive Christmas disorder but obsessive-compulsive disorder. I was misdiagnosed for 15 years and just recently began the correct treatment of Exposure and Response prevention about 8 months ago. During that time I have learned how misunderstood this disorder is and how often it's used in the media as an adjective or something ""everyone has"". During the deep difficult parts of treatment, I went looking for OCD merch and all I could find was obsessive Christmas, cup, cat, etc disorder. There were a few things I could find on OCD but not many. So instead of waiting on someone else to make it, I made it myself.

Here is my shop! \[OCD Stickers\] [OCD Merch](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Obsessivelystrong)

Whether you choose to get something or not I want to get visibility out there because I wish I had Merch when I was going through the worst of it. You can also find my on instagram for more OCD education [u/obsessivelystrong](https://www.reddit.com/u/obsessivelystrong/).

The entire time we’ve been together he has been extremely sweet, thoughtful and considerate. I really feel like he’d be an awesome supportive partner long term. Our sex life has also been pretty fantastic. 

We have opposite personalities in a number of ways - he’s extremely extroverted, gregarious, life of the party, always chatting up strangers…I’m an introvert, crave a lot of alone time, and can be inhibited. Very different energies. 

For reasons I’ll clearly need to explore more in therapy, the differences in our personalities has been triggering some strong insecurities within me, and I feel awful about it. It makes me feel like I’m not witty enough, interesting enough, outgoing enough, or intelligent enough for him to want to be with me long term. He’s also extremely intelligent and worldly, and I often don’t get references he makes in conversation. It makes me feel like I live under a rock and don’t know anything, and it feels embarrassing. 

I feel like I’m just waiting for him to wake up one day and realize I’m not what he wants, or enough, and he’ll end it. Like I’m just waiting for the rejection to come. Even though he’s given me no evidence he feels that way (quite the opposite: he invited me to a vacation with his closest friends in two months, asked me to be his gf, brought me around his family when they came to visit). I’ve also given him no indication I’ve been feeling this way. I think it’s also important to note I’ve dated many men over the last year and haven’t felt these feelings as much as I do now. I’ve always been insecure about my shyness/have some social anxiety which is maybe why the stark personality differences are triggering it. I feel like I’m self sabotaging before I get hurt. 

These feelings make it hard to be totally vulnerable with him and fully let my guard down. 

How do I find the courage to fully lean into this blossoming relationship without fear, and trust the evidence I DO have that he sees a future?",1673968952.0

I get overwhelmed so easily.

Well, turns out I have most likely gotten a position. It is at a high school, working as a food server, dishwasher washer etc among other tasks. I got this position through my mum who also works there.

The boss called me today and asked what experience I had. I told her I had experience working at the football as a cashier and food server. I didn't tell her this was my last job in 2012. I used to get so anxious.

But I am scared. I want to push through my anxiety. Teenagers make me nervous as I used to get severely bullied in school for being the shy fat girl. I've since lost over 58kg.

How can I cope with this irrational fear? I am worried I won't be able to keep up because it's very fast paced and I get overwhelmed. I am worried I'll be shy and awkward. I know these fears are stupid but I'm just scared. 🥲

The boss said I can't be guaranteed shifts the same as my mum but she can try to work with it.

I guess I am just looking for some encouragement and advice on how I can deal with all these doubts. I want to live without fear and without my anxiety holding me back!!",1673930822.0

Have you ever seen everyone around you excited for the new year’s resolutions they’ve set for themselves while you are just not that motivated to set ones or are too busy struggling with things going on in your life to be in the new year’s excitement pool?

Well, I know I have. And if you’re experiencing any struggle with your mental health then odds are you know that feeling as well.

Entering the new year is a time for further horizons, fresh starts, and new goals we set out to achieve…for some people. For others, it can be an extremely difficult time to continue struggling with our current situation, whatever that may be, while everyone else is excited for these fresh starts.

We know that issues with our mental health don’t work on a schedule; crippling depression doesn’t expire when the ball drops in New York, petrifying panic attacks don’t disappear after jumping seven waves in Brazil, eating 12 grapes or Soba noodles won’t eradicate us of bipolar disorders, sharing soup Joumou doesn’t cure our anxiety disorders, and hearing the bell of Big Ben echo into the night sky won’t help us with our eating disorders. 

Suffice to say, mental health isn’t on the clock, there’s no punching in and punching out. It’s breathing down our neck 24/7. So while new year’s is a great celebration and all the power to people who are excited for a new year and improving their lives, let’s take a minute to acknowledge the other side of the coin. 

I feel like new years is equivalent to the social media of global celebrations. And what I mean by that is we tend to see a lot of people’s highlight reels during this time. People are celebrating and acknowledging the goals they set the year prior and have now accomplished, setting new goals and aspirations for the coming year and getting all amped up to pursue them.

And don’t get me wrong, I am very happy for anyone who sets annual goals and has a genuine drive to put in the work towards them, I am not against them whatsoever. We are all in that position some years! However, it can feel almost impossible to be one of those people if we are struggling with our mental health. 

If I’ve been struggling with depression since October then I’m not going to feel the motivation or desire to set any new goals in life. If I’m dealing with anxiety that is preventing me from being able to hold a job or go to the gym then how could I possibly set goals for my career or working out? 

So, please understand that you are not the only one feeling depressed by everyone around you setting new year’s resolutions or feeling pressured to bite off more than you can chew just to keep up with your friends, family, or co-workers. I’ve experienced this so many times at new year’s and when you’re seeing everyone’s highlight reels it can feel like you’re the only one, but you’re not.

We don’t have to set goals according to other people’s schedules or the annual calendar. If you need a few more months or an unknown amount of time to work on your mental health then do that. By the same token, if you find yourself in a good place in November then set new annual goals for yourself at that time. 

It’s easy to feel the pressure of new year’s resolutions happening all around us but there’s nothing wrong with walking our own path, especially if it’s leading us towards better mental health. 

Okay, so what if we find ourselves going into the new year struggling with our mental health? What if we still want to set goals for our lives because it’s extremely important but feel like our mental health issues are acting as a roadblock? 

I can’t answer that because I don’t know everything, not even close. What I can offer you is what I’ve done in my own life and maybe that will be of some value to you. What I do is I look at the largest issue with my mental health, the aspect that is having the most negative impact on my life. Then I look at what some solutions are for that problem and set one or two of them as my highest priority to work on. I set one or two goals for the year based off of this self-analysis.

For example, right now in my life I struggle with anxiety, depression, panic attacks, OCD, and a phobia. Out of all those struggles with my mental health, my phobia is having the largest impact on my daily life. So, I looked at solutions to overcome my phobia which are doing an online program called The Thrive Program and exposure therapy.

Those two activities are now my highest priority because they will lead to my phobia having less impact on my life, therefore, increasing my overall mental health. I set a weekly or daily goal for doing them everyday and that’s my annual goal. 

We have to focus on not letting our mental health steer the wheel in life while at the same time knowing when we need to make decisions to improve our mental health and what those decisions or goals are. And we need to remember that sometimes life just gets in the way and we aren’t ready to completely revamp or improve every aspect of our lives, and that’s okay. It’s okay to take a step back and focus on one thing (mental health) to invest all your time and energy into in order to be happy. 

So if you’ve felt depressed or pressured going into this new year just know that you are certainly not the only one, there are so many of us in the same boat, and that it takes courage to choose your own path and prioritize yourself and your happiness. I hope you take that step with me.",1673904537.0

They ran some tests. Vital tests, they checked my heartbeat, my temperature. They test also my urine. All test went normal.

Then, he said that I have anxiety. He referred me to go to psychiatrist for further tests. 

Am I clinically diagnosed? After that I didn't go to psychiatrist because my parents said I was just going crazy and they just talked to me always so that I can distract myself.

They are not high maintenance by any means but i just stopped having any energy or motivation to even play or cuddle with them. Or pay any attention to them at all to be honest. A few months ago my female cat started puking everywhere, which grabbed my attention, and learned that she has some food allergies and had to change her diet.

445,Feeling worse after starting therapy?,1,10b9ymf,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/10b9ymf/feeling_worse_after_starting_therapy/,5,"I started therapy last November, I have it once a week with BetterHelp. I’ve had therapy since I was 19 but it didn’t ever help me enough to feel it change my life in any way so I chose a different course of therapy and we’re delving right back into childhood and past traumas. I’m opening up about a lot of things in a much deeper way and really surrendering myself to it because I want to feel better for once. I like my therapist (which is rare for me) but this last week or two I’ve been feeling worse than I’ve felt in months. I already have a current chronic pain episode that is lasting months right now but in terms of my mental health, (which chronic pain has a huge affect on) I’m just feeling more and more symptoms of my older self… (I mean when I had a lot less control over it). 

I have almost constant palpitations, sweats when I wake up, shortness of breath, dizziness and I’ve been having episodes of depersonalisation almost daily which freaks me out so badly. 

I had depersonalisation episodes from early childhood but I didn’t understand them and got over them on my own with focus and never ever spoke about it to anyone except the therapist. I only had them maybe once or twice a year and didn’t know it had a name and now I’m having them daily.

Is this normal for therapy? I’m happy to dig up my past if it means a better and happier future and I’m trying so hard to be an open book. I broke down for the first time in therapy ever last week and I felt so stupid. 

I also have this feeling that I’m not doing it right or something, I realise how stupid that sounds but sometimes she asks me these questions and I don’t know how to answer and I immediately feel like I’m supposed to know the answer and then I’m scared of getting it wrong… that’s a trait I’ve always had. 

I just thought I’d be feeling some sort of sense of even mild relief, I know it’s early, I’m just concerned that it’s making my symptoms arise and in full force …

I have been with my fiance for almost 4 years. Our 4 years anniversary of us dating was going to be our wedding date this April but something happened after Christmas. She decided to postpone the wedding till next year. At first I was ok(ish) with it because originally that is what I recommended but she wanted to make it sooner. After days of really thinking about it. The more depressed I got feeling about it. Why a change in heart all of a sudden? What did I do for her to get cold feet about the wedding? The more I thought about this. The more the anxiety magnified until I kinda blanked and told her that if her heart isn't in it anymore then we should split. She told me that she needs time to figure herself I and I do the same. I scheduled an appointment to a psychiatrist coming soon but ever since that conversation I have felt depression on a scale I have never imagined. I have been having panick attacks and bout of just bawling my eyes out. I just feel so helpless, empty, numb, sad, shut off from the world. We're still together but she is keeping her distance from me and I am respecting her boundaries. I can't even remember the last time I cracked a smile or actually had a decent conversation. I really hope that we can work things out and get our relationship back on track because I am terrified of loosing her. I just hope she feels the same way about our relationship.

I haven't really had a job up until now because I've always been too scared to get out there. I also gained a lot of weight in my 20's staying at home not caring about myself. I have since lost over 58kg and have more to lose, but I'm in a better place physically. Another thing that stopped me was commuting via my town is hard due to me not having a car license and public transport being minimal.

I now have the opportunity to work at my mum's workplace. She works as a food server, dishwasher, etc at a high school. I am extremely hesitant to apply for the position because the one thing that's stopping me is kids make me anxious. I was severely bullied all throughout primary and secondary school simply because I was the shy fat girl who wouldn't stand up for herself. I am also worried that it will be too fast paced and I'll get overwhelmed. If I worked there, I wouldn't have to commute via transport at least.

I am also hesitant because I have a sore hip a lot of the time. Qorried I won't be able to stand for long periods..

My younger sister may also be starting there. She is the opposite of me. She is outgoing and will talk to anyone.

My heart is racing as I'm writing this... How can I take that first step? I need a job. I want to stop being at home and depressed. But I also want to finally travel before I get a job, so that's one thing that's stopping me too.

458,Grounding Technique For Anxiety Relief,10,108tn0w,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/108tn0w/grounding_technique_for_anxiety_relief/,6,"Anxiety can be an extremely scary and emotionally draining experience affecting us at any time through anxiety attacks and panic attacks. So how do we get some anxiety relief? What can we do to decrease and calm our anxiety during the times when it starts to get bad?

I find that knowing the inner workings of the grounding techniques I use help me have faith in knowing they will work because I understand them rather than blindly following them. So, let’s take a peek behind the curtain to understand what anxiety is and how grounding techniques counter it. 

Anxiety, to be put quite simply, primarily involves worrying about uncertainties about the future. We tend to have a flurry of thoughts rush through our mind about all the worst-case scenarios that could happen to us in a certain situation, be it a minute, hour, day, week, or year into the future.

Grounding techniques, again put simply, are thought exercises designed to bring us back into the present moment by occupying our thoughts with things that do not cause us anxiety. When we are on the verge of an anxiety attack or panic attack, we are thinking about the future and find it hard to focus on the present. Grounding exercises are the pause button that put us back in the present where anxiety does not thrive.

So, what is this specific grounding exercise that I love so much and how do you use it? Excellent question! This grounding exercise has us go through the alphabet and search our memory to think of names beginning with a specific letter. I call it the ABC Name Exercise.

Now I know what you’re thinking, Jackson, how did you come up with that name and what does it mean? Well, see it’s an exercise about names and the alphabet so I–(technical difficulties due to offensively boring explanation). 

What you do is you think of 5 names that start with the letter “A,” then once you complete that you move on to the letter “B,” then “C,” and so on. You can also pair this with your favorite breathing exercise to calm yourself even further. 

I like to take a deep breath in through the nose for 4 seconds, hold it for 4 seconds, and out through the mouth for 4 seconds. I do that between each name or between each letter. Do whatever feels best for you!

You’ll find that in most cases it can take you a good five or ten minutes to get through the alphabet and it can alleviate your anxiety before you even reach the end. If you are still anxious by the time you hit “Z,” just start over with different names this time!

You can also experiment with it, try doing just 3 names for each letter but they have to be people you’ve met in person. Or only fictional characters. You can think about books you’ve read, movies you’ve watched, songs you’ve listened to, and so on. 

Get creative with it, you want it to be a challenge. I will sometimes get stuck on the harder letters and really have to rack my brain to get through it. But if you find it taking you more than a few minutes you can always skip the letter. You don’t want to get stuck on a letter and end up going back to thinking anxious thoughts so keep tabs on when your mind starts to wander from the exercise.

To give an example, the last time I used this technique was just last week when I was getting a haircut. I was feeling really anxious in the chair and wanted to escape. So I texted my girlfriend and she texted me each letter while I sent her the names I came up with and by the time we got to the letter “P” I was feeling much better!

That’s another great thing about this technique, you can use it by yourself or have someone else do it with you where they keep track of the letter you’re on and the number of names you’ve come up with so far. You can say them out loud or come up with them in your head.

This grounding technique has helped me a lot whether I’m pulled over on the road having an anxiety attack, in the middle of the night having a panic attack, or having a hard time in the middle of class and just need some anxiety relief.

Try it out next time you’re feeling anxious and don’t forget to pair it with a breathing exercise!

I hope this grounding exercise helps you with your anxiety as much as it’s helped me.",1673406082.0

Wherever I used to go people looked at me differently, always got weird stares from creepy people in public. Like I've started working on myself since this covid thing when schools closed down and lost around 10 kgs and still losing but sometimes trauma from past forces me to stress eat.

I went to the best and the most prestigious school in my entire state, i was very much privileged and it was all okay till grade 6 had a lot of friends and everyone around me, but something happened to everyone around me after that. My best friend since pre school who was the smartest person in the class stopped talking to me, ignored me and never told me why. Obviously i wasn't the smartest person like him but i was okay at things. That made me cry because for 8 years straight we hung around almost every day, talked about our personal lives and shared our feelings and what not, he was the perfect companion and it gave me a big hit when he left me. The stress eating problem of mine probably started then. I did make 2-3 very good friends but we all split schools so there was no one left in highschool I knew of.

Being short and chubby i used to get bullied a lot and the worst part is even the girls did it. Entering highschool people have even worse stares, seniors too and the worse part was yet to come. One day this so called stud came up to me and hit me really hard in my butt, litrally spanked me in front of everyone in the canteen and since i was fat it made that sound to which everyone laughed, he did it and ran i chased him but i looked like typical fatso running which was also for some reason funny. I cried myself to sleep that night.

The next day things like these started happening and i was in no position to avoid them because no one was by my side. Being called fat, being spanked in public, being humiliated and what not. They also sometimes came and touched and pinched my chest and ran off. The worst and the most traumatizing event ever was when this Group of girls came and humiliated me just to get the cool kid groups attention. Never really talked to a girl so when this kinda popular grp came i was nervous. That came up to me talked friendly and out of nowhere one of the girls poked my chest and said you probably need a bra and walked off. Like literally it was fricking disgusting. That day onwards i used to get comments from everyone even the people i don't know. 

All these events instead of telling me to move away from them, for some reason told me to join their group. Started making fun of myself, spending shit ton of money on the cool kids group to be accepted, invited them to parties with alcohol to seem cool but never got invited myself and what not. I literally destroyed my grades just because i wanted to be accepted.

Somehow i passed and then covid hit, pushing me away from all these aholes and just letting me find myself. I had a great time, i spent time with my loved ones who helped me lose 10 kgs and gained confidence in myself, reconnected with my actual friends whom I'm still in contact with and a lot of other good stuff. I was away from all this i was still fat but the regret was less. When the last year of high school started again for exams i was this new human being. The stud and the cool kid group tried to pull of shit again but couldn't. I made fun of them , still nervous about the girls didn't say a thing to them, but the boys the got wrecked. The stud even came up and tried to poke my chest and i grabbed his hand and crushed it showing that my fat kid strength is greater than anyone around. The next today these aholes shut up. Talked to me normally.

After this came college and that's when the problem started. It was my first time moving to a different state away from my family with absolutely no one i know. I got into a top 10 college for accounting and finance and was surrounded by a lot of smart people. I was happy at the start but for some reason i really needed a female touch. Like i never had a relationship and I've been always attracted to females a lot. All the girls I've liked, I've seen them drift away from me, like other boys like studs taking them that all happened and it made me jealous of them. I mean i wanted to be like them like an all rounder tall, good looking, fit, good at studies and what not. These people i was jealous of partyed and still got better grades than me. I wanted to be one of them.

Coming back to college, i was happy that I was with more mature people who care about my personality more that my looks and money, and in the first week i made this friend and he was the stud. So i hung out with him did the same shit but realised things will repeat so i cut him off. I thought wow this is over but my biggest slef confidence issue starts here. After cutting him off i get back to work and gym and here's this girl i like, we were in the same club and i talked to her. In a week the stud guy who was my friend whom I cut off, gets together with her litrally, and it hit me. I didn't mind it that much and continued my work, but it happened again. Another girl i liked in my class, i started talking to her in confidence helped her make a resume made her laugh etc etc. Plus i was not looking at a realtionshp now, i happens again, coincidentally she join the stud guys group after a month and stops talking to me. It seemed like the stud kept coming and taking things away from me like dud tf. He also started making fun of me in the class, like making comments, and the same highschool shit but less frequently. A very good friend i made now is in his group and doesn't talk to me.

I'm now sturggleing with self confidence issue, i don't speak well in front of girl like it litrally shows them I'm socially awkward. Smae happens with me when i go to tall, good-looking guys, like all rounder. I always seem to think they're superior than me and become akward and I'm never really able to show my true personality, wit, strength etc. In short i sometimes let them all walk all over me humilite me i just go back and cry. It affects me in every way and aspects 

I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with this issue I wanna solve this and talk to everyone well. I wanna feel superior too. I just feel like they never talk to me. No one ever approaches me no matter what I do or continue talking to me after I start. I think they find me boring as i get awkward and have small talk whatsoever .",1673155835.0
473,Vent,3,106eck0,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/106eck0/vent/,1,"When I’m not distracted by my daily tasks and I’m alone with my own thoughts, I think about how debilitating anxiety can be.

I can’t say that I’ve ever experienced a life outside of this feeling. I’ve been in a perpetual state of panic and anxiousness that makes me depressed when I think of how much of a recluse I am. It’s taken away so much of my youth that I’ll never get back. I’m almost certain it’s stripped away a completely different version of myself that I’ll never get to see. 

It’s weakened me to such a deplorable degree that I can’t recognize the person I see in the mirror. I don’t even see a person sometimes, I just see a lifeless corpse that’s been beaten so many times they’ve become unrecognizable. 

At this point in life, I’m supposed to be focused on very important things. I graduated high school a few months ago and am currently in college. I should be exploring my options and attempting to figure out what I want in life, but I’m so far from ready for that. Everything about that expectation is terrifying to me. Not in the sense that it is for every young person, but to someone who has been comfortable with withdrawing from the joys that life has to offer at every chance due to the fear of uncertainty these situations can have. 

I’m so terrified of failure that’s it’s caused me to despise every step you’re supposed to take in order to be successful in your future goals. Any pathway, any direction scares me. And I know that if it wasn’t for that stupid part in my head that constantly fills my brain with the expectations of a normal adult, and then degrading me for being the wimp that I am, maybe I would’ve made it somehow. 

But I don’t hold any hope for that. And the fact that I’ve become so accepting of it is what has disappointed me the most about myself.",1673167523.0

I have turned messaging off for anons & in general I had it off for a while before this & I just recently turned it back on & hate about my art is the first message I get that's really sad to me. I know my content is not as good as others, I'm well aware that there are better creators on Tumblr, but why do people think it's ok to say someone's content is bad?

Until recently my boyfriend went on a Work & Travel programe to the US, and things shifted. 
I called him in the middle of an anxiety attack (he gets it and is the one that wants to help) and told him I felt distant and forgotten with him not talking to me for days. He said he’d do better and was very sweet. 
This week my depression came back strong, very strong. Suicidal thoughts and all. He also didn’t speak to me for over 3 days, all the while viewing my messages and being online in all social media replying to everyone. I feel humiliated and not wanted… all I can think of is how he doesn’t want me anymore and paired with the rest of my life, I don’t see the point of being here at all.

And usually if I had mentioned I needed to take 3 days off a month for medical treatment for health reasons, the interviewer would raise an eyebrow and tell me to leave. Not this place.

Keep in mind, I applied as a kennel cleaner at a veterinary office. And the air when I walked in was just…something felt good about it. I caught one of the assistants’ dog dashing for the door. He was so cute! And he was promptly scolded like a toddler-full name and all. It had me struggling to maintain my composure from giggling form glee as I waited in an exam room for the interview.

So the tech comes in, and this nice lady comes out. My last animal experience was about 10 years ago, but I spent about 5 years in animal husbandry, and I am darn passionate about it. I was open and honest to make sure she and I were on the same page. I was ready to walk out when I mentioned I had depression until she said “in this world, who doesn’t? How is your treatment going?” 

This left me stunned. Of course, this is a medical facility with medical staff, so medical discrimination isn’t as common as other sectors-even though it’s zoological. I mentioned my ketamine and told her I understand if she didn’t feel comfortable having someone like me around, but I make sure it’s clinically done and schedule things ahead of time. She was COOL with it, so long as I kept up with it to prevent symptoms from coming up during work. Again, stunned.

At this point, I was floored. We went through other standard interview stuff, and I am likely eligible for a work interview soon. It’s a waiting game now. 

I was so happy that I froze with a shit-eating grin. My husband makes the money in our relationship, but he wanted me to find a job I liked to make friends and find purpose. This is BIG! And I can’t get over the fact that someone like ME can get a job, let alone one working with animals. I am perfectly ok with cleaning bodily fluids and cleaning bandages if it makes the critters happy.

I am currently taking 20 mg a day of fluoxetine (generic version of Prozac). Some of the issues I’ve had/still have while in dental school are:

- being able to pay attention and focus during lectures
-being able to regulate and complete the tasks I need to accomplish in a day 
- motivating myself when I need to complete a task and feel down/unmotivated (typically procrastinate and dig a deeper hole to crawl out of)
- ability to retain information during high stress situations (exams) 

I’ve been succeeding so far in the new semester on small quizzes and assignments, and am able to focus a bit more when it comes to lectures, but still have issues completing tasks (as in I complete less than half of what I realistically should/could do in a day). I also have to remediate/retake exams I failed last semester and apparently some of my teachers have “concerns/doubts about my abilities” according to my student advocate (who is not allowed to be at the meetings the faculty are having discussing my performance).

I find it hard to see these people don't end up with the consequences of their sin and eventually get chronically depressed and anxiety for the rest of their days.

They maybe deserve that in some peoples eyes. But is there anyone out there who thinks they don't... 

In all honesty they don't want their life back, they want a world where they can't hurt anybody most importantly including themselves. They are asking for a miracle.

But what if that miracle is as close as everyone using their emotions to end it all for them.

So ask yourself... Will you use your mind/emotions to try and end suffering or believe people deserve it and promote suffering?

It's just too late for some people, they are judged harsh, physically tortured and dont want their life back obviously, the only thing they want to actually hear or want is people wishing them a new world where they can't hurt themselves.

Why do you judge so harshly? Or why do emotions judge so harshly...

And why is God so harsh, these people never did anything that wrong, I mean it ended up with them being in a lot more pain than it did their victims from what I can tell. I don't want to believe in God.

And so what they never conceived a child? What you don't know won't kill you. Better off, I use my emotions to pray that their offspring would be recieved in the universe just like the first humans did.

I do everything I can for people I fear are in turmoil. Do you? 

I just want to you to believe they suffer more than we know. It's all they talk about. 

I've cried over the pain they must be in...

They've cried too because someone believes them...

Im sick and tired of telling them things will be okay in this life, im a strong believer that when we die we are reborn again. 

And I see no good future for them thus leading them to an eternity of chronic depression and physical pain...

God did warn of physical torture and that is what these people are experiencing, the wrath of God.

But if God isn't real, what is hurting them so much? Is it people (Their emotions) or life itself (unfortunate circumstance)... I'm a strong believer it's people

These people were depressed at one point and clearly decided to torture themselves, is that fair? They just have the ability to do that...?! NOT FAIR!

How can I live a nice life knowing people are torturing themselves for all of eternity and I'm doing nothing about it.

Anyway. This is supposed to be a chat, hmu with your thoughts, I hope their are more sympathetic people out there!

What are the physical sensations? Are they obvious or hidden? What are the emotional sensations of anxiety? What goes through your head when you’re suffering from anxiety? Maybe you’re wondering these things because you experience anxiety yourself or know someone who does. Well today I am going to share with you exactly what my anxiety feels like to try and answer some of those questions, at least from my personal experiences.

Please keep in mind that all mental health disorders, battles, and struggles are uniquely experienced by each individual. Your answer to the question “what does anxiety feel like” may be completely different from your mother’s answer, your friend’s answer, the store clerk’s answer, and my own answer. We all experience pain, fear, and discomfort in our own ways and one person’s experience never belittles or compares to another’s. With that, let’s dig into the details.

So, what does anxiety feel like for me physically? Anyone with an anxiety disorder struggles with two types of physical sensations, short-term and long-term. Short-term anxiety symptoms are ones that happen in the moments when we experience heightened anxiety, anxiety attacks, or panic attacks. Long-term symptoms are things that tend to be recurring or daily issues in our lives.

For me, short-term anxiety symptoms include shortness of breath and that feeling of being unable to fill my lungs entirely with a deep inhale, tightness in the chest, my heart beating faster, my eyes darting around the room looking for an escape, and sometimes I will sweat or shake. 

My long-term anxiety symptoms include difficulty sleeping and trouble getting out of bed in the morning, being more easily irritated or depressed, feeling fatigued throughout the day, stomach issues or nausea, and the inability to concentrate effectively. 

When it comes to the visibility of these physical symptoms, most of them are easy for me to hide from those around me. Sometimes I can experience an anxiety attack and unless you were looking directly in my eyes you wouldn’t be able to tell I was having one. 

So keep that in mind because it goes to show that anyone around you could not only be struggling with anxiety in their lives outside of their interactions with you, but they could also be on the verge of an anxiety attack standing right in front of you in line at the coffee shop.

Now you might be wondering when and where anxiety tends to flair up or become more intense. This is largely dependent on the situations in life that trigger the anxiety for any particular individual. These can be extremely unique or exactly the same between different people. 

For myself, the times that my anxiety and all the symptoms that come with it are increased is when I’m on public transportation, traveling far from my home, away from my family and partner, eating in public, in crowded spaces that are hard to exit swiftly, and at nighttime just to name the main ones.

But to highlight how triggers can vary from person to person a great example is public transportation. I have a friend who has very little issue driving long distances whilst I have extremely high anxiety in that situation. We also can both take the train but have different levels of anxiety for that as well.

It’s quite similar to how you may have a fear of heights whilst your friend is not at all fazed by them. Anxiety is the same way except slightly less rational fears and triggers due to the nature of anxiety making mountains out of molehills in life.

Now that covers the physical symptoms of anxiety but what are the mental and emotional symptoms? What goes through our heads when we are anxious? What emotions do we feel?

Whenever I am anxious I get flooded with a number of emotions such as fear, panic, self-loathing, sadness or depression, loneliness and feeling like a burden. 

Fear is the most obvious one, I am extremely scared of the situation I am in and I have thoughts racing through my mind faster than I can process them. I think about all the worst case scenarios of the situation, I get scared that I’ll have a complete mental breakdown and have such a severe panic attack that I’ll be hospitalized. It’s a toxic cycle of fear and panic.

Sadness or depression will kick in because mental health struggles are extremely difficult to deal with. I might start thinking about how many limitations my anxiety is putting on my life and get depressed at the thought of never being able to climb a mountain or live in a major city. I could look back on opportunities or experiences I’ve missed due to my anxiety and feel regret towards them.

Self-loathing will happen when I view myself negatively and think of myself as weak or inadequate which anxiety can absolutely make us feel. And I will feel like a burden sometimes to those around me if my anxiety is causing us to cancel a trip, cut something short, or just require someone to give more of their time and energy to supporting me. 

Of course, while fear and depression are valid feelings when going through issues with anxiety I want to make it clear that no one should think they are a burden or inadequate due to their mental health struggles. Those are the feelings that we can experience from anxiety but should not fall victim to believing them because those negative thoughts we have are not true.

Anxiety can happen for unknown reasons. Some days are better than others; I have weeks and even months when my anxiety is low and I feel great. By the same token I can be doing great one morning and be a complete mess that afternoon. Anxiety can slowly build up over hours or it can go from 0-100 in 10 seconds. 

So those experiences make up most of what anxiety feels like to me. Please keep in mind that this is personal to my experiences with anxiety and others can experience anxiety in completely different ways, locations, and varying degrees of intensity. This is solely a representation of my own.

Lastly, anxiety can make us feel extremely lonely. It can make us feel like we’re the only one in the world suffering through this awful circumstance and despite how powerful our loneliness can get, we need to refrain from ever forgetting that we are, in fact, not alone. *You* are not alone.

I just laid out what anxiety feels like for me and if you suffer from anxiety then odds are you resonated with at least one thing I struggle with. And that’s why I share these struggles and experiences of mine with you. I want you to know that we are in the same boat, you are not alone, and that gives us comfort and confidence as we work together on improving our mental health. 

You’re not alone, and I’m in your corner cheering you on.

501,How to convey my depression mess is apart of me,5,102m2gi,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/102m2gi/how_to_convey_my_depression_mess_is_apart_of_me/,0,"I’ve been deep in a depression for awhile now. I graduated college and have been struggling to find myself. I haven’t found a job, I’m still working part time on my campus and am living at home. I run a small art shop and have essentially taken over my family’s kitchen table as my base of operations. 

I turned that table into a hell hole. My art supplies, random receipts, paint, brushes, books, random cords, weed and empty boxes of matches; literally it was a spot I didn’t have to upkeep. My dad would always make comments about the mess and so would my boyfriend. I felt this massive guilt but I was so overwhelmed by the mess that I didn’t know where to start. When I come home from work, I’d just throw my keys and purse by the table and just not have to think. 

Recently my boyfriend helped me clean the table. We threw everything into boxes and put it in the trash. Got rid of clutter. Now all I can see is me having to go through those boxes and reorganize them and find a new home for the clutter. That thought makes me so tired and just want to cry. 

Now that the table is clean, it’s just empty. I feel like I’m grieving in a way. Sure I appreciate that it’s clean and useable, but it’s just so weird. It’s not messy. Now I have to keep it clean and that just makes me so fucking tired. My boyfriend simply does not understand why I’m sad that the table is clean. I don’t know how else to convey that it just makes me tired. He’s always been a clean person and I’ve always been the messy one. I feel ashamed and I know he’s so confused about why I’m crying over a clean table. I guess it signifies the loss of something, but I don’t know what it is. 

Has anyone else gone through this? Mourned the loss of mess? My room is still a disaster so that’s the next spot I have to clean.  I just don’t know how to convey the depths of my depression to my boyfriend. He’s been so supportive and wants to help me clean but he just doesn’t get it. I can’t find words to help him see how I feel because apparently we aren’t speaking the same language. Help?",1672785983.0
502,Hello my name is David,5,102dvgy,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/102dvgy/hello_my_name_is_david/,0,"

This is my story of how I perceive and deal with this shitty condition.  I believe the trigger was a weed cookie, but there is much more to it. I am still struggling with it, but I would say it is about 50-60 % better. 21 savage would say -  A LOT. I am so happy I got to this 50-60 % and I know anybody who is not quite there yet would also be extremely grateful. So let's dive in. I will be short, I promise.


1. step is acceptance. You got to say, hey dpdr I know you are a part of me. I know you will probably be following me all my life. I will tell you later what is great about that. So yeah you (dpdr) and I are one. Okay, step one 1 doneee.
2. step is saying f\*ck u to it. You got to be a boss. You say I know you are here but screw you, I know I am stronger than you. That boosted my confidence.
3. You got to find a source.  **I believe we all know our weak points, we are just too ashamed to admit them.** For me, the problem was talking. I did nooot want to talk. I was very reserved with words. That led to bad relationships with my father and mother. Also, I had constant fears about all things, especially success and school and so on. I was ashamed of myself, not in an obvious way. I just was not happy with myself so I would not be myself around people.
4. Step four. **HUSTLE**. You constantly need to push yourself to convert your bad habits. For instance, I pushed myself to express my feelings and my thoughts. I did not do that for a looot of years. I believe it is very hard to fight these, so it is nice to have some help. Also, I became very conscious of my thoughts. If I sensed a bad thought I would accept it and throw it out. It takes energy to do that all day. So if you are also looking for a way to shred that body it's a good workout.
5. **PROFESSIONAL HELP.** I am seeing a shrink. Would recommend it if you can afford it. Don t be weak and go talk to him.
6. **ALTERNATIVE HELP.** I strongly suggest 20 deep breaths 10 minutes after you wake up. You will feel a little tingle in your brain. I hated that at first but now it feels soo good. Don't underestimate this step. It can do wonders.
7. **CBD.** For me, this was like working out on steroids without the negative effects. Seriously I felt the effects after 3 days. I felt this inner peace in my chest. It felt so good. I was not afraid to be me again. It really helped me express my feelings. Go read about it. I believe it is the next big thing. We live in this fast pace world that we will not be able to handle. 

I hope this helped you just a little bit. If you have any questions, I am here for you. And also **DON'T READ ABOUT THIS CONDITION EVERDAY. IT IS GREAT YOU FIGURED OUT THAT YOU SUFFER FROM DPDR. BUT THE MORE YOU READ THE MORE YOUR THOUGHTS PULL YOU BACK.** 

**Till next time, David.**",1672766934.0
503,Physical manifestations,1,102nutn,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/102nutn/physical_manifestations/,1,"Can I ask, is it normal for mental illnesses to manifest themselves as physical symptoms?
I always thought of mental illnesses as primarily a mood issue.

I had what my psychiatrist identified as a mixed state episode over a year ago (although he first thought it was severe anxiety and later agitated unipolar depression). This was the first time I had anything like this in my life, at 41. When I had it, the idea that it could have been a mental issue was the furthest thing from my mind. 

My symptoms started with my stomach; I felt like I swallowed stones and like someone was stabbing me from the inside. I had a feeling that an alien was trying to come out from my chest; it felt excruciating. I felt like my brain was on fire; like it had fever (but not the normal kind) and no amount of pain killers could make it better. I had this unbearable nervous energy where I had to pace sometimes for 10 hours a day. I couldn’t sit still. I had to squeeze things (because of this ‘alien’ inside). It was all accompanied by feelings of terror, anguish and despair. I was screaming every day “what the hell is happening to my brain”. I couldn’t sleep or eat; those things were the first to go.

I had some moments of respite mostly in evenings for a couple of hours. But every day it would start anew. The only logical ‘solution’ was strong feelings of wanting to end this pain. In fact when I had actual physical pain, I felt relief from this other, ‘alien’ pain.

I couldn’t understand what was happening (and still don’t) but in the end was persuaded to see a psychiatrist. It took a while to find the ‘right’ meds (because of change in diagnoses). SSRI seemed to have made things worse. Low dose Mirtazapine and later Quetiapine stopped this; after 3-4 months of pure agony. My god what a relief that was. Lamotrigine was added later and I feel more or less as before (except for the weight gain from the meds and generally being more on alert and as if I acquired PTSD from it).

I guess what I am asking is: is any of this ‘normal’? (In relation to mental issues and its presentation). I couldn’t imagine this in my worst nightmare. I’m scared it will come back. Is there any chance this could still be some other, physical illness? (I did most of the tests, including brain MRI. Everything was unremarkable).",1672790264.0

I have severe General Anxiety Disorder and mild Depression. Mostly it feels like my emotions swing from one end to the other and I get overwhelmed and irritated super easy. I also was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. I have run the gambit of meds and every so often I start getting paranoid about my medicines causing some of my issues and how many meds I am on. 

My biggest issues are hot and cold flashes, JAW PAIN, joint pain and inflammation and sooo much anxiety lol. 

&#x200B;

The meds I am on is Gabapentin- Busporine- Zoloft- Hydroxizine

I quit taking Gabapentin 5 days ago. Im not really sure this has helped with much except the hot flashes.

Stopped taking hydroxizine because the cotton mouth is INSANE!

I THOUGHT buspirone helped with your bodies reaction to anxiety (i.e. tension in your muscles and jaw). But I also read it can CAUSE muscle tension. WTF! ANYONE KNOW? Jaw pain and pain around my jaw line and ears is something I suffer with alot!!

Was upped to 50mg of Zoloft, but i noticed over the holidays that I was very lethargic and uber calm. At first I was like OK....but I felt like I lost my joy in the holiday in the calm..if that makes sense.

&#x200B;

At this poitn I have no idea what to do!! Its like a double edged sword! And my brain is just sooo dang busy all the time it is hard for me to track how my body is feeling and my memory is crap so I always ""forget"" how it felt to be on vs off something.

My therapist and my parents tell me that I need to change my mind so my mom force me to do things, I do it but to be honest I just want to hit my head and I make useless thing like I just made some tea knowing perfectly I will not drink it. 
I tested so many medications for anxiety and nothing works, I also have special ""treatment"" in school (I don't go to some classes and I don't do oral) but it feels like it doesn't change anything.
I feel awful and I don't know what to do

However, when a person experiences excessive anxiety or anxiety that interferes with their daily life, it can be a sign of an anxiety disorder.

Anxiety disorders can affect a person's daily life in many ways. They may experience physical symptoms such as racing heart, sweating, and difficulty breathing. They may also have difficulty sleeping, concentrating, or completing tasks.

Anxiety can also lead to avoidance behaviors, such as avoiding social situations or certain tasks. This can impact a person's relationships and ability to function in daily life.

In severe cases, anxiety can be debilitating and make it difficult for a person to carry out their daily responsibilities and activities. If you are experiencing anxiety that is affecting your daily life, it is important to speak with a mental health professional for treatment and support.

My husband, bless his soul, is a fantastic individual who would never want any harm done to me, EVER. He’s jumped through so many hoops to try to get me well, and I can tell he’s at the end of his rope. He can’t stand seeing the love of his life slowly die like this. 

I’ve gotten fat, as in it’s hurting my heart and will affect my health (he doesn’t care how I look, but he’s in the medical field, so he is well aware what those pounds do on the inside). He has seen the heart-attacks of his patients, and he’s scared by my family history and wants me to live a long life by being healthy-not thin-healthy.

I’ve gotten sick from vitamin deficiencies not being outside in the sun. It’s gotten to be where I’m taking supplementation, but my bones are still dissolving from lack of vitamin D and lack of exercise. I’m neglecting myself to death. 

So he’s put up an ultimatum: I exercise at least 30 minutes a day of moderate to intensive level activity, and I get outside in the sun for an hour a day, or he’s leaving by the end of the year. He doesn’t want to watch me die. He’s tired of hospitals and nothing working. And we have therapy, medicine, and even infusion medical treatment on our side right now. If nothing worked and I got worse, I wouldn’t want him here to see my demise either, so I am in full agreement. 

He’s so desperate for me to get better, to smile and to no longer suffer. He’s done all he can do. I need to step up too. 

Right now my fate is in my hands. And dammit….I needed a bit of a threat to get me off my butt. 

Happy New Year. This is life-or-death, and dammit, I’ve made a choice to come out the other side or die trying.",1672592629.0

Then, you even go out to eat with a friend and have a great convo. Maybe you get a bunch of good deals at the grocery or find out a bill was 100.00 lower than you though it would be. Just a really happy and productive day.

At the end of it though, instead of being happy, satisfied and relieved or feeling a sense of accomplishment, you sit there just raging with anxiety and feel like your about to jump out of your skin.

I'm 30 years old and still deal with extreme stuttering over the phone and while talking to strangers. This leads me to skip some serious situations which demand me to speak out. I know I have to talk to people but I'm not able to. I feel very under-confident. However, I'm super confident over text and in social media. I'm getting married in 2 months and I'm stressed out because I have performance anxiety as well. It doesn't affect me when I am on my own but when I'm with her and we get intimate, the anxiety kicks in and I cannot perform. This makes me sad and hopeless for the time being. However, she understands my situation though. We always try later on and it eventually happens. But I cannot get over this anxiety inspite of knowing that I can actually do it but this demon comes back whenever I think of the next time we have to get intimate. Also, before I forget, I have toilet phobia as well and I am scared while going out for a long time and the idea of not having a toilet around kills me.

I was on Lexapro for 5 months for anxiety/depression back in August 2022. It was hell the first few weeks and then it worked amazing on my anxiety and intrusive thoughts. But then I started having sexual side effects and weight gain that was really affecting me so doc switched me to Wellbutrin 300mg. Im still having sexual side effects from lexapro (slight improvement tho) and I have read here for some it became permanent. Also read that Wellbutrin caused permanent tinnitus for some. I’m on week 3 of Wellbutrin and it’s caused me anxiety and it’s made me realize that I just don’t want to deal with permanent risks or constantly switching meds until I find the right one. A part of me wants to fight this naturally and not have to risk permanent damages to my body. I know this isn’t something that is an option for everyone but I just feel this way. I didn’t tell my doc but I’ve decided to wean off Wellbutrin. From 300 to 150. Im on day 3 of weaning off med and yesterday I had a sudden panic attack. I was able to get out of it and go back to normal but my anxiety has increased for sure. Scheduled an acupuncture session. Never tried it but hoping it helps. Ordered natural anxiety capsules and considering CBD. I’m sorry I’m saying so much but I’m hoping anyone has some words of encouragement or advice. I didn’t tell my doc cuz he’s my primary and not a specialist plus he didn’t warn me about potential permanent side effects. Any one try natural remedies that worked ? Am I an idiot for weaning off? I just want to get through this without meds. Thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this.",1672581732.0

I feel useless and like a burden to my parents, who have other things to deal with than taking care of their fully grown, adult child. 

I want to get help but i'm afraid to ask for it for fear of being judged or adding yet another thing for my parents to have to deal with. I have anxiety about driving and would need some one to get me to and from potential therapy sessions which I don't want to inconvenience them with.

thing is right away she started seeing some old friend of hers and two weeks times they were together and she evolved from a ""i"" to a ""we"" twice as fast as that. we moved in together December 2021 and from that point on he made himself at home and she let him, even knowing how uncomfortable it made me at times.
it's been a year and things just escalated because I was afraid of talking about how I feel.
worst of all is that my therapist went on maternity leave in October, and I didn't contact a substitute.
I bought an apartment this month but can only move in February. My friend and her bf are going to stay in the rented one and we're supposed to do it staring January bc at first I was told I could move into my apt in about 2 weeks, when that changed I told them and apologised but they didn't tell me that bc I could only move out in Feb he would come only in Feb.
yesterday she asked me for rent money and I was confused, told her that I couldn't pay the bank and half our rent and that I didn't understand why I had to if they were moving in together in Jan.
that's when she told me they'd change their plans, and then started acusing me of lying and only telling half truths, among some other more untasteful stuff. I stood my ground and apologised for the misunderstanding but now I feel like shit about it all, like it's all my fault for driving people away once again. I know that I've done wrong but I also know that it's not all on me. 
Even though I can't keep the thoughts at bay. I feel that need to feel physical pain, to hurt myself again. And it's getting harder.

# ✅Try aromatherapy: Certain scents, such as lavender or chamomile, can have a calming effect on the body and mind. You can use essential oils, scented candles, or room sprays to incorporate these scents into your environment.

# ✅Practice gratitude: Focusing on the things you are grateful for can help shift your attention away from anxious thoughts and feelings. You can try writing down three things you are grateful for each day, or sharing them with a friend or loved one.

# ✅Use positive affirmations: Repeating positive affirmations to yourself can help reframe negative thoughts and boost your self-confidence. For example, you might say to yourself, ""I am capable and worthy,"" or ""I am strong and capable of handling challenges.""

# ✅Try progressive muscle relaxation: This technique involves tensing and relaxing different muscle groups in your body, starting with your toes and working your way up to your head. This can help relax your muscles and calm your mind.

# ✅Try art therapy: Engaging in creative activities, such as drawing, painting, or sculpture, can be a therapeutic way to express your emotions and reduce anxiety.

# ✅Practice mindfulness: Mindfulness involves paying attention to your thoughts and feelings in the present moment, without judgment. This can help you become more aware of your anxious thoughts and learn to let them go.

# ✅Consider animal-assisted therapy: Spending time with animals, such as pets or therapy animals, can be a relaxing and enjoyable way to manage anxiety.

# ✅Try herbal remedies: Some herbs, such as valerian root and passionflower, have been used for centuries to reduce anxiety and promote relaxation. However, it's important to speak with a healthcare provider before using any herbal remedies, as they can interact with medications or have other side effects.

# ✅Seek support from others: Talking to friends, family, or a support group can provide a sense of connection and help reduce feelings of isolation.

# ✅Try journaling: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can help you process your emotions and identify any patterns or triggers for your anxiety.

I don’t know what it is, but where I’m from in California, a lot of people I’ve encountered are stuck up, “sophisticated,” and at times, feel like they’re more important than others….even having the audacity to look down upon someone like myself, especially when I explain the autism, depression and anxiety, saying “oh i feel sorry for you! why can’t you be normal like the rest of us? could you please be less annoying?”

I think one of the things that frustrates me and hurts me is when I tell others I’m autistic, they’ll be an asshole, saying “ooooh…..that explains so much”….like you actually know what it’s like in the mind of an autistic person everyday!

Daily use of any substance especially psychoactive is connected to big health risks and dangerous withdrawal. This is just a thread to summarize your experiences and opinions on using DXM for depression, social anxiety and other mental health issues.

I don‘t want to use it daily, max. 1x a week to introduce it into my cycling plan so I don‘t have to use lyrica or kratom daily anymore and can switch them. Rn I‘m only using Lyrica as prescribed for 2 weeks doing some days off here and there, but I don‘t want to prolong this use due to tolerance & withdrawal risks of regular lyrica use - even if prescribed like this. I‘d love to be able to use Lyrica 1x a week, Kratom 1x a week, DXM 1x a week and that‘s the cycle. Day off between everytime. Just some insights into why I‘m creating this post + the fact to have a reddit post to collect all the information, science, experience stories and opinions regarding DXM for mental health issues.

DXM works similar to Ketamine and is now even used in a new 2023 antidepressant medication (called „Auvelity“ containing 45mg DXM + 100mg bupropion/wellbutrin compound). This new antidepressant, which should act rapidly in comparison to other ADs, is meant to use daily for weeks to months (as most antidepressants) so it seems that science sees the danger of daily DXM lower than usually thought.

There are a bunch of people having success with DXM treating their depression & social anxiety with it. Only a few examples:

Or comments like:

„Dex also helped me with my social awkwardness and helped my confidence a lot.“

„This is analogous to a dxm trip i took yesterday. I took a much smaller dose, but noticed a huge relief in social anxiety. I much better at just thinking of what to say in any particular situation i imagined. This is probably related to why ketamine and ibogaine are so effective for depression and anxiety, both if them being huge dissociatives“

„It [DXM] works great for me at low levels. I usually take 60-120mg a few days a week and it yas been incredibly helpful for my depression and anxiety. It seems to be helping my ADHD, as well. At that low of a dose I don't really feel ""fucked up"" and I find that I actually function even better.

I've been on a variety of different meds / treatment combinations for debilitating anxiety and depression, OCD, and bipolar II since I was a teenager (with a couple stints of being off them completely). Many of them helped to an extent; they allowed me to function and reduce the frequency of severe depressive episodes. But they also came with a lot of negative side effects and more so numbed my emotions, so the depression felt more mild, but so did my joy.

I did ketamine infusions last summer, followed by at home nasal spray for maintenance. After my 3rd infusion it was like the cloud that has hung over me my entire life was completely lifted. It didn't just blunt the pain. It actually healed it and allowed me to face my pain and try to work through it. Unfortunately.....

(Official/medical) Ketamine is very expensive and not covered by insurance. I was doing a ton of in depth research about the science / mechanisms behind it and that's when I discovered that DXM works in an extremely similar way as ketamine and there is actually an antidepressant that's close to FDA approval that combines DXM and Wellbutrin.

The cost is way more affordable on a long term basis. It all comes down to knowing the window of effectiveness and taking the correct dose.

TL:DR: smaller doses of dxm, taken a few days a week can help depression/anxiety tremendously (seems to also help ADHD). Its underlying mechanisms of action are very similar to ketamine, but DXM is way more affordable.“

A bit about the Psychopharmacology via Wikipedia:

It is in the morphinan class of medications with sedative, dissociative, and stimulant properties (at lower doses). Dextromethorphan does not have a significant affinity for the mu-opioid receptor activity typical of morphinan compounds and exerts its therapeutic effects through several other receptors.[6] In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder.[7]
Dextromethorphan is also used recreationally. When exceeding approved dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogen. It has multiple mechanisms of action, including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor[8] and a sigma-1 receptor agonist.[9][10] Dextromethorphan and its major metabolite, dextrorphan, also block the NMDA receptor at high doses, which produces effects similar to other dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine, nitrous oxide, and phencyclidine.

Dextromethorphan has been found to possess the following actions (<1 μM) using rat tissues:[14][30]
* Uncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptor via the MK-801/PCP site[30]
* SERT and NET blocker (cf. serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor)
* Sigma σ1 receptor agonist
* Negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
* Ligand of the serotonin 5-HT1B/1D, histamine H1, α2-adrenergic, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors

Dextromethorphan is a prodrug of dextrorphan, which is the actual mediator of most of its dissociative effects through acting as a more potent NMDA receptor antagonist than dextromethorphan itself.[31] What role, if any, (+)-3-methoxymorphinan, dextromethorphan's other major metabolite, plays in its effects is not entirely clear.[32]",1672314180.0

The worst part is I have no symptoms of hsv yet my mental health has plummeted into darkness. I keep praying god would just let me go out peacefully.

586,Is there any treatment for retinitis pigmentosa?,2,zvc0of,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/zvc0of/is_there_any_treatment_for_retinitis_pigmentosa/,1,"
My mum has retinitis pigmentosa, which is an illness that causes a person to lose their eyesight gradually.

She’s had it since she was a teenager and now she’s basically almost blind. 

The doctors have said that there’s no cure.

I have tried searching for some solution since doctors can sometimes be wrong. But I can’t find anything. Well I actually found a clinic in Germany who deal with this illness but they haven’t responded to my email yet.

This illness has really affected my mum’s mental health. She cries sometimes because she feels inferior. 

She was planning to go abroad to visit her mum after 3 years. Usually me or my brother go with her, but I can’t go due to work. And my brother can’t go due to his depression. 
So my mum has to cancel her plans and she’s very upset. So is my grandma, because she was really looking forward to seeing her daughter

588,My First Panic Attack (7 Years Ago),1,zuzjh6,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/zuzjh6/my_first_panic_attack_7_years_ago/,0,"I struggle with a lot of mental health issues that cause a lot of challenges in my day-to-day life. I look around on the internet and there are a lot of people sharing their stories and I want to share mine as well. So, I thought the best place to start would be my first panic attack.

My first panic attack happened when I was 15-years-old, about 7 years ago, in my Grade 11 physics class.  We had a reading period for the first 20 minutes of our second class everyday when everyone was silent, sat at their desks, and got to read whatever book they had at the time. I personally loved reading period but something was different that day and it wasn't something I could really predict. I didn't feel any different going into the class but as soon as I sat down it started.

I sat at my desk in the front row and the classroom was completely silent. I started to feel this sensation in my chest and in my legs quickly building–a numb tingly feeling in my legs and a tightness in my chest. My heart started to beat fast and my breathing started getting short. If you've ever experienced a panic attack you know that these are the telltale signs but I had no idea what was happening. I was very uncomfortable so I immediately ran out of the room in front of the whole class which was not not the best feeling in the world. 

As I was feeling all these sensations it became very uncomfortable and I wasn't sure what I needed but I was positive about what I did *not* need and that was to be in the classroom any longer. I bolted for the door and ran out of the classroom down the hall to the bathroom and just needed a private place to figure out what was going on. 

At the time I had no clue what I was experiencing and thought I might have been having a heart attack! I had no idea that it was mental whatsoever. Obviously, it had physical symptoms but I didn't know that it was a panic attack. In fact, I hadn't even heard of a panic attack at that time in my life. 

I remember being in that bathroom terrified and not even knowing what I was terrified of. Like most panic attacks it peaked after about 15 minutes and then slowly died away but I was definitely prepared to go into the hall and get someone to call 9-1-1 or get me to the school nurse to be looked at because I genuinely thought I was going through a physical attack of some sort, at the time it was very traumatizing.

The way the classes were set up, I had that physics class in the same period for the entire week so I had reading period for the first 20 minutes again the following day. I walked into the same class, sat down to do my reading, and again the same sensation hit me. I ran out of the class and I hid away in the washroom waiting for it to go away.

It was around that time that I suspected it was not physical and was more mental but I had no idea what was happening before this point in my life. I was definitely an anxious kid growing up; I had struggles with mental health before that point in my life but it was the first time I had experienced something that severe and gripping.

Essentially, every reading period after that I had to sit in the hallway and read because I didn't know what the cause was but I was severely uncomfortable being in the classroom in any of my classes when reading period occurred. As time went on I learned about myself, my anxiety, my thought processes, and I learned that reading period was a trigger for my anxiety.

It was one of the things that would cause panic attacks for me because it was a situation that I felt I couldn't escape from. But at the time I had absolutely no idea what was going on. I didn't know what a panic attack was, I didn't know what was happening to me or why, and I didn't know what was causing it. 

All I knew was that this thing was having a large impact on my day so I started taking my book and reading outside in the hall for those 20 minutes for all my classes. Of course, there are a lot worse situations I could have been in–at least I was comfortable in the hallway and didn't have panic attacks anymore. But the point I want to hit on is how uneducated I was and and just how naive I was about what I was going through.

If I had known what I know now it definitely would have helped me in the long run a lot sooner to identify panic attacks and that reading period was one of the triggers of a panic attack. I don’t know why they started but the great thing about anxiety, panic attacks, and a lot of mental health issues is that you don't need to know what caused them or why they started. All you have to know is your present situation and learn the skills and solutions to your current situation.

So, if you're going through any of these things as well or something even slightly similar then we're in the same boat and I think that hearing other people's stories and learning about their experiences can really help us with understanding our own circumstances.

If I had other peoples’ stories to read about when I was in Grade 11 I would have been able to identify the panic attacks. I would have started looking up resources for panic attacks, why they were happening to me, and coping mechanisms for them. I would have discovered meditation and learned breathing exercises.

I went through a long period of stumbling through the dark so I think that the major benefit of us sharing stories with each other is that those of us who are stumbling through the dark can learn different resources. I think it can shine the light onto the dark corners of mental health that we otherwise wouldn't receive so that's all I really want to do by sharing my stories with you.

If there's anything that I want to leave you with it’s that you are *so* much stronger than you know and you need to remember that you are capable of so much more than you believe. It is so important to have faith in yourself even when you feel weak because it helps us get through those really tough times like panic attacks.

I always like to speak and share with others who deal with similar feelings. I've had anxiety since I was a kid. I remember my first Panic attack. I was in the back of the family station wagon. Started to feel like I could not breathe. Dad pulled over and we stood on the side of the interstate for probably twenty minutes. I remember asking if we could walk home. I think due to the adrenaline. So fast forward 25 years and I still deal with it. Now the symptoms have changed a bit. Sometimes I feel like I cant breathe. Sometimes my head feels off. Sometimes it's just sheer panic. Sometimes I feel like the panic lingers for days on end. I have some meds that I take as needed. But then I worry if I keep taking them ill never learn to cope without the meds. I've quit drinking alcohol due to the anxiety it causes the next day. I've always enjoyed drinking but I feel it's not worth it anymore. I have two beautiful children who are healthy, happy. A very loving and caring wife. I dont understand why this anxiety comes and goes the way it does. I called an ambulance last weekend on my birthday due to a panic attack. I knowing better checked my bp while in  the midst of worrying and of course it was high. After meds and paramedics reassuring me I had calmed down. Bp went back to normal. But since that day, which was a week ago. I have been struggling. Just fear and worry. Everyday since. It's so exhausting. I want to beat this. Or learn to cope with it. I want to feel normal. I want to be a good strong father to my children. I try to write in a journal daily. My Dr. Wants me to start taking daily meds. Which I'm nervous about. Anyways. There is so much more to say. I just don't know how to share all my feelings at once. ""Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid or terrified because of them. For the lord is with you.

I've been battling it alone since then. I've been through the worst moments of my life when I was in university where was extremely suicidal and genuinely thought it couldn't get worse than that. Somehow I got through it alone yet again. Once university was over, I felt a bit better, like I could compare my life to the darkest part and know I'm never going back there so my situation has always felt like it's not that bad. 

But now I'm completely done. A few months ago I was living my best life, was a bit lost in life but I had therapy and medication. My own home, my cats, a great job and overall I was just doing things that made me happy. 

I'm back living with my family due to some family complications that only I could deal with even though I have 2 other siblings. I'm genuinely in such a bad place. I had to leave my job, my home. I tried to make the best of it, I brought my pets and my hobbies. But I just can't anymore. My meds aren't working. My brain is not working. I just want to spend all day in bed. I just cry all the time. And yet again my family doesn't suspect a thing because i am able to remain functioning just to help them but as soon as i go to bed or wake up for the day im already in tears. People keep complimenting me for how I just left everything to help my family but I'm so messed up. It feels awful to be praised for it because I resent it everyday. I genuinely want to just not exist anymore. 

I'm at a point where if I have to go back to my old life which i will get to in a few months, idk how I'm gonna keep living. Nothing seems worth it. Everything feels empty. My hobbies, my life, everything just ends up miserable no matter how much I try and try to make a life I'm happy with. I really wish God would give us a choice on whether we want to live or not. I didn't want to be put on this earth or live, or go through all these tests. I just want out. I don't care who is affected once I'm gone, I have no attachments to this life.

And if one more damn person says ""God puts us through these tests to make us stronger"" I'm going to scream. I dont f**king care about these tests.

I’m not just talking about feeling nervous or sweating or something like that. I’m talking about trouble talking and serious auto sabotaging.

Here some examples related to my main activities:

1) I could study a piece of music 1000 times. I could play it perfectly in my home alone, or even if I’m aware that ppl are passively listening to me. But I swear, if someone is, let’s say, behind me purposefully listening to what I play, my memory starts vacillating, my brain starts “hurting” and becomes kinda numb and white, and I suddenly waste hours and hours of studying and practicing, thus resulting incompetent and imprecise.

2) The same happens when I act. Especially in theatres, because it includes my whole body. I am a professional actress and I’ve performed a lot, but this cannot go on. I’m not enjoying fully what I do and I live throughout every performance with severe anguish. This is not how I want to work. This is not how I carry on. There’s like a limiting “virus” in my brain that turns on whenever I am in a performative stage. Or in a performative situation. I could study whatever and for many many hours, but I’d be worried about my memory and my body would be sorta freezed. I do not feel free, I’m always subconsciously and consciously controlling that nothing slips out. The only time when I fully felt free was when I drank on stage for a sorta drunk-sluggish character. In that moment I forgot about everything and truly felt everything I said and lived the scene with my whole self. This being said, I do not intend on becoming an alcoholic, I want to resolve the root of the problem.

3) same old shit happens when I sing. I have a very strong voice,  but when I sing in public or at exams I always have to force myself to get it out. It stays in, tucked in, it won’t come out as much. It’s like an auto shrinking mechanism. And I feel so so bad, because I know what I can do, but others cannot see it fully and that does not help.

I don’t exactly know what it is, but I have the feeling that listening to some type of subliminal could drastically help me with this. Of course if you have alternatives on how to resolve this, let me know. I’m very open to try different approaches.

Even when I try and talk to them it also feel like I’m being ignored. These interactions I’ve had have been getting to me lately, it’s been making me question if I’ve done something to make people uncomfortable or if I’m just weird or something. It’s just been giving me really bad anxiety to the point where every time my boyfriend even mentions attending a family function or going out with our “mutual” friends I just get riddled with anxiety and try to come up with an excuse to not go with him or for us to stay home. I also put mutual in quotation marks because Ive been feeling like they enjoy his company more than mine. Idk I could just be me overthinking thin but it just hurt to be so blatantly ignored like that. 

I’m sorry if this doesn’t make much sense or if it’s too long I just needed to get this off my chest.",1671534876.0
614,Upping the dosage?,2,zqrbfp,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/zqrbfp/upping_the_dosage/,2,"I wanna keep this short but basically my therapist suggested I ask my psychiatrist to up my dosage and speak with her. I went in yesterday and told her and explained how I’ve been feeling really down and stuff, at first she suggested I keep the same dosage which is 40mg of an anti-depressant and suggested I try to get out more and set more boundaries around the things that are causing my anxiety and depression. Towards the end I started feeling helpless because although I don’t care if the dosage changes I just can’t feel like this anymore it’s overwhelming and is causing more suicidal thoughts which I let her know. She wrote me a prescription for the same dosage I was taking and I couldn’t help myself from starting to cry. She held space for me then asked why am I crying and I told her I can’t take feeling like this anymore. She then told me something along the lines of “it’s okay, I’m increasing the dosage to 60mg and this was the symptom or reaction I was looking for before deciding if it was a good choice to increase the dosage”

Every time I've gone off, I've ended up going back on after a few months or years. I know Paxil has intense side effects, but once I start taking it, it's like I'm a new person. It's worked so well for me I've always gone back to it, even though they don't prescribe it much anymore. 

For some reason the sexual side effects were worse the last year or so, to the point it was impacting my marriage. But my life was feeling pretty stable, so I decided to go off Paxil in June to see if it was better this time and get rid of the side effects. I was doing well for several months. The anxiety kicked back up, but I was managing it okay... until the last \~6 weeks. It's been steadily downhill and I'm just feeling like I can't handle life anymore. 

My psychiatrist suggested mirtazapine as an alternative to SSRIs because they have no sexual side effects--he did tell me about potential increase appetite but I \*think\* I could deal with it okay. On the one hand that sounds fine, but on the other hand, the SSRIs have always worked so well for me (side effects aside), and I haven't really heard anything about others taking mirtazapine... so curious to hear others' experiences.",1671461235.0

When I was 17 I first called a professional cause I knew there wasn‘t something right with me and this suffering isn‘t normal. It mainly all started being surely problematic with 17 but the symptoms probably even started with 10 or earlier, at least I can think of similar symptoms back in these times.

So I called the doc at 17 alone first time, letting no one else know, and I got treatment. Now, 23, I‘m over 14 different medications and 3 talk therapies (psychotherapeutical depth psychological as well as CBT) all without NO success. I‘m now 23 and just got off Mirtazapine and Wellbutrin 1 week ago. Also I got off Kratom at the same time (started using he Kratom cause no treatment worked).

I now lay in bed since Saturday, doing nothing, can‘t eat, can‘t drink, can‘t move. I even quit my job on Friday. Still studying my master (have a bachelor at least already). But I just feel hell as shit now and don‘t know anything to do, I dont see any hope or any future. My cognition is also very bad, I feel like the dumbest and most worthless human. I lay way behind everyone else in my age regarding knowledge or skills, let‘say any professional knowledge but also about any sports (like following professional soccer, basketball or even playing it), I dont have any knowledge about anything, sports, cars, professions, sciences, literature, anything.

My doc just prescribed me Lithium now as next trial for medication. She told me to start taking it on Tuesday. I still didnt‘t start taking it cause I only can read it using for bipolar, never ever any studies or such for depression itself (without mania) or social anxiety and rn I just survived the day by drinking 3 beers, not eating anything or drinking more than a glass of water. I feel retarded, sad, socially incapable and dumb and no clue how to go on. Life has nothing to offer for me, it‘s such a big draining unsurvivable feeling of sadness and being imcapable.

Thinking about suicide and hosted psychiatry many times but also just looking for a quick fix as other people my age and „friends“ just live so happily and have their way rn so I dont wanna be the crazy guy being in a psychaitric wardness, especially as Id how it would help me after these many faile treatments.

I decided to change meds because I started to feel very suicidal and did not want to live anymore.  That has mostly subsided but honestly I just feel kinda numb.
I've had 2 kids over the last 4 years and that's why I was on ciprilex.  Paxil always worked well for me in the past so just thought I would give it a try.

But then life just keeps throwing stuff at you and eventually it gets to be too much.

I was really proud of myself for cooking an actual meal for the first time in ages and not just shoving something in the oven or microwave. Today I don't even want to cook. I'm told I just do what I have to do. Clean up, wash clothes etc but I just don't have the energy. And when I do stuff I just feel guilty for congratulating myself.

I just feel pathetic that I'm proud when I do minimal tasks. I'm told if I fail at achieving the tasks it's fine but what's the point in me setting them only to feel the sting if failure and that's it.

Some days are better than others, as most of you know. Anyway, my question...it's difficult to put into words, but I'm hoping someone understands, because I feel like I'm on the verge of freaking out for no apparent reason. 

Basically, very rarely, I'll start to get this weird feeling. Like, I'll feel...off..not myself...wrong? I don't feel right. It's kind of like that feeling you might get when you have that intuitive feeling that something bad is about to happen, but with this, it's more subtle. Subtle, but just enough to make you a little uncomfortable. It's that feeling, mixed with the feeling you get right before you have an anxiety, or panic attack. 

I'm trying to think of a better way to describe it, but that's all I've got right now. If anyone has an idea of what I'm trying to describe, I just want to know if you have any suggestions on what I can do to help make this go away. I would really appreciate anyone's help. I've tried everything I can think of, but nothing has helped.

653,Anxiety or Dysautonomia?,1,zllfvz,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/zllfvz/anxiety_or_dysautonomia/,0,"Okay I am not sure of the trigger of my symptoms but this are the likely triggers and the symptoms below:

1. From early Last year I had anterior pelvic tilt that caused my breathing to be more shallow and my general posture was out of whack. This caused pelvic floor issues like constipation, ED and made me very stressed.

2. Mid last tear, I got a prolapse due to the pelvic floor dysfunction and this stressed the hell out of me for a long time due to the fear of the complications and since surgery doesn’t really work. I was in fear, panic health anxiety, etc due to this.


3. Late last year I had the Vaccine and was sick after this for some weeks; i later got better but still I remained fatigued and i started to have digestive issues like constipation, diarrhea, etc

Subsequent to this, from early this year till now I started to get the symptoms below:

- My breathing became very shallow (feels like i am not getting oxygen)
- I am usually very hot unless the air conditioning is put on
- I feel very nervous and get panic attacks (e.g from the sound of calls, emails, door knocks)
- Exercise intolerance 
- Dizziness and blurry vision
- Trembling 
- Insomnia (i never feel rested and wake up in intervals)
- headaches
- I feel sad and in a bad mood

A month ago, I came across the 4-4-4-8 breathing exercise (which i did with my back layed down and my knees raised up) and for the first time in the year i started to feel like all of those symptoms went away;

- breathing got better
- I was happier
- Constipation went away
- I slept beautifully etc

However if feels like the results are temporary and that i relapse after a day or even some hours.

Now i have heard people say different things like:

- this is purely anxiety disorder 
- some say it is problem with nervous system and that the breath exercise stimulated the vagus nerve
- some say it is caused by covid or the vaccine.

Question:

Is there anyway to be sure that this is dysautonomia or just anxiety? How can this be resolved (any success story)

I've had a, so called, best friend from school (we've been friends for about 8 years) and for a long time she was the only person I could talk to without feeling awkward. I wasn't diagnosed back then and honestly don't know if I even had depressive-anxiety disorder then but I always found making friends stressful and terrifying so I just stuck around with her and occasionally with her friends (she was really 'popular' at school). Then, around 6th grade, a new girl joins our class and this 'bestie' of mine befriends her which in turn makes me befriend her as well. As time goes by, me and new girl start hanging out after school almost every day, text and talk even more than I did before with this best friend of mine. I remember thinking 'Wow, it's like we've been friends for years!', that's how well we were getting along. Time passes, about 3 years, she's moving to a different city for highschool. I'm sad of course but I'm sure that we will keep in touch still. Well. She stops texting me first, or only texts sth short and whenever I try to get a conversation going she only replies with 'haha', ''yea' or 'okaay'. So obviously I'm upset but I'm just thinking that that's because she's adjusting to her new life in a different city or she's busy. But then one day I'm in the mall and who do I see? Her AND my best friend, hanging out together. Meaning, she must've been texting her, told her she was coming to town and made plans to meet, with neither of them telling me a thing. And I wasn't even sad or mad about it then, I stupidly came over to say hi, all excited to see my friend after like 2 months. Anyway so that's where it ended with that new friend. Long story short, I go to the same highschool as bestie, we hang out together but start talking less and less with each day, she starts hanging out with some other classmates, stops sitting next to me in class and then changes classes mid term without telling me a thing. In the end I stick around with one of my classmates, we become friends and it's great, we text all the time. Well, lately she found herself new friends and started to hang out in a big group (that we were never part of before) and doesn't even say hi to me when she sees me. After all that I just can't help but feel like I am always going to be the one to get left behind.

I’ve seen No-Fap teens who claim they have the knowledge of the Gods and YT gurus state that the Gym is good for breaking down social anxiety. I truly believe it is and feel exuberant when I bum out a work out. Today was an entire different story however. Lemme tell you why. 

I’m 22 at the moment and hit a breaking point recently. My family sucks cow dick, I grew up from a lot of verbal abuse, moved from different schools/states multiple times, and needless to say I’m a black male who has seen countless media that depict how scary the world “can” be for us. Needless to say my social anxiety is at fucking large. A week ago I said enough and decided to edit my diet, see a therapist, meditate and go to the gym consistently. I even got a personal trainer. Our first session went well so I figured alright this is okay let’s keep this up. And for the most part it was ok until the trainer threw a rope ladder on the ground.

My whole buddy buzzed as I started to calculate what the fuck the rope was going to be used for. Just like that my trainer (Matt btw) began to side shuffle in between the empty spaces left foot and right foot in swift motion, jumping all the way down one way before he came back to me. “You got that?” Matt said as I stood there back stiff as a board. “I think so”. I stood in front of the rope and stared at the mirror in front of me which showed the reflection of all the people working at the gym. The worst part is 20ft from my right side maximum was Nelly, the gym worker and the most gorgeous woman I’ve ever seen. 

I looked back at Matt and said “can you show me again? My coordination feels off right now”. To be completely 100% that was true, my anxiety made it feel like I wasn’t even within my body and even if I tried to move I would’ve looked like the Terminator doing the Dutch. “You got that” Matt went again. “Sure”. I started moving and exactly like I said they might as well have casted me in place of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Part of me wanted to run away and say “I’ll be back” too. I eventually stopped and frustratedly told him I couldn’t do it. “Don’t be frustrated if you can’t do a workout, it will lead to failure. That’s why I’m here to guide you” Matt replied. Matt is 19 btw and I’m 22.

But the thing is I wasn’t frustrated I couldn’t do it, I was frustrated because I could. Needless to say I’m here for advice on how you gym boys/girls handle this or hear your stories. While I believe the gym can help social anxiety, it can most definitely highten it as well. I want to eventually make it to where I can move my body freely and lose focus around me, because as my workouts get more intense I’ll require that. And this isn’t just in the gym, it’s in any social gathering. It’s enough anxiety attacks your mind but it hits the body too….. At this point I’d rather fight Corona.",1670649446.0

She obviously needs professional help, but she is in no state to go to therapy. She can't go downstairs so she definitely can't speak to a therapist. She went on sertraline, which was a massive step forward, but she had some sort of reaction to it, and just stopped taking it rather than speaking to a doctor.

However, if you look at it differently, it explores the effects of a loved one’s passing on a person

  
**😇Inside Out-** is Disney’s most popular film that talks about mental health. It’s about 11-year-old Riley as she begins to discover new emotions and her teenage angst as she goes through puberty.

  
**🌈Soul-** It talks about life after death – and the biggest questions in between it. Here, a jazz musician ends up in a place called The Great Before. If he ever wishes to go back to his life, he must find the answers to life.

  
**🌴Coco-** Coco directly tackles the effects of dementia on the elderly. While the film doesn’t show it upfront, we eventually get to see exactly how Mama Coco suffers deeply from the condition. Disney also shows that despite the condition, it’s never too late to help others remember the good old days by some means.

  
**🐠Finding Nemo-** the film talks about trauma and anxiety. In it, Marlin faces deep anxiety about the predators of the ocean after losing his wife and all but one of his children to a barracuda. Eventually, Marlin owns up and recovers from his trauma.

It’s gotten much better and I’ve been on medication for that length of time. Most people wouldn’t know I have either of these.

I’ve been working from home since Covid and have become extremely lazy. I don’t feel like doing things I used to enjoy doing, like baking, knitting, reading. I have no motivation and am constantly tired.

The worst part is that it is affecting my work. I was promoted to a senior project role where the work is quite difficult and there is a lot of it. It is overwhelming and I have had breakdowns during work because of it. My boss is aware I’ve been struggling as I am very open about it. But I went from being on top of everything to procrastinating on every task. I wake up in the morning and think “I can’t do this” so sometimes I just don’t do any work. This obviously is terrible and gets me more behind but I am so exhausted I feel like I can’t do it. This has been going on longer than I care to admit. When I get energy at night I spend the time feeling guilty and trying to convince myself I’ll do better tomorrow.

I’m in this exact situation at the moment.

I don’t have the worst speech but I stammer a lot more in high pressure situations where my communication skills are under scrutiny, such as in job interviews.

My stammer has always been a big insecurity of mine and has massively limited me in both my career and personal life. My shame around it and relentless effort to conceal it with people has forced me into being introverted, quiet, reserved, socially awkward and anxious. I know deep down that this is not my true, authentic self. The real me is chatty, open, sociable, outgoing and comfortable around people. Not being able to be true to myself and express who I truly am around people is the most frustrating feeling in the world.

Constantly trying to appear fluent is so mentally and emotionally draining in social situations and makes me feel so disconnected from myself and people. This has led me to become more and more reclusive over the years. It hurts my soul to not be able to freely interact and express myself like non-stammerers can.

I hate the person it’s turned me into. I’n consumed with feelings of self hate, worthlessness and inadequacy every day. I literally have no life and feel like such a pathetic failure :-(

I managed to somehow pluck up the courage to attend lots of job interviews in 2018 and was rejected by all of them. This seriously knocked my confidence and I haven’t attended one in almost five years due to fear of rejection.

I don’t want a job right now because I don’t feel I could mentally cope with any kind of responsibility, performance pressure and tight deadlines. But I do desperately need one because I am really struggling financially.

The phone interview invitation is for this Tuesday or Wednesday. I haven’t responded yet because I’m in two minds. Do I attend knowing that I am highly likely to mess up due to my poor mental health and speech difficulty? Or decline for this very reason?

720,sensitive to criticism,20,zatf1q,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/zatf1q/sensitive_to_criticism/,10,"I definetely grew up with a lot of criticism. It came from both of my parents from a young age, in different forms; mocking, shaming, ignoring my feelings and occasionally being spanked or having some of my stuff destroyed. The main reason of all this was the fact that I was a very introverted and shy girl, and my parents were very upset whenever I could not normally socialize with people, or were too afraid to do something. I would cry and hide away and they would lose their patience because I was too much to handle. So from a young age I thought something is inherently wrong with me and I am to blame for the way I am.

These experiences have obviously made me to have very low self esteem, be very negative and pessimistic, to have anxiety and depression on and off, and to be very very sensitive to criticism.

I have recently been harshly criticized, rejected and threatened (not physically) by a person that is in my work environment. I know this person is very insecure and sees people as threats, so I can understand where the attack came from. Also I know that, most probably, I share some responsibility for their frustration as well. I could have done some things differently, though I never attacked her or showed any hostility. However, despited realising all this, this hostility has crippled me! I have been having anxiety attacks the whole week, can't sleep or eat well and I am constantly ruminating on the event, thinking how useless I am and blaming me for everything, catastrophizing about how this will affect my work later on, generalizing it (that everyone thinks  the same way about me)... I have travelled back in time and feel the way I did when I was 5 years old.

I am in therapy but I still struggle with reacting to criticism and my next session is in 2 weeks so I feel helpless.

Does anyone who is sensitive to criticism have any tips on how to stop thinking so excesively about something distressing? Any positive self affirmations or routines that have helped you? I have to say I wasn't able to confront this person yet, I am super scared and anxious that the moment we speak I will break down and start crying and apologizing for things I shouldn't :(",1670005495.0

Tonight, for example. I've been in my apartment since 4pm and did absolutely nothing for six hours, just sitting on my couch and browsing on the internet.

I will be talking about THC in this, so if this is a trigger, stop now. I'm a little high now and this is a moment of vulnerability for me to try and open up a little in sincerity. 

I only recently started using edibles to unwind within the last few years, around the time COVID started. I had no friends or social life and was recently divorced. The lock-down took away the few efforts I was making at venturing out more, so I figured I may as well make the most of being alone and started getting high. I was barely past 42 y/o and had squandered my youth and let my insecurities keep me from making an effort. Blah blah blah, poor straight white guy with problems BS, to some of you, but screw you, this is my own life and I'm allowed to he affected by own personal experiences. 

So, I had a routine of coming home from work, having dinner, taking a shower, and getting comfortable for the night by the time my edibles kicked in. I'd then, somewhat predictably, would spend the rest of the night relaxing, watching movies or YT videos, playing video games, snacking, relieving other tensions, and then just listening to music in the dark. Stereotypical shenanigans for someone 20 years younger than me, but the best way I'd had ever found of dealing with my anxiety. It also awakened a new passion for films, television, and music, which again is cliché but it is what it is.

Now that I'm married again, I can't get high nearly as often. My wife doesn't mind, as long as I let her know I'm planning on taking an edible. She has her own past dealing with such things, both the upsides and the downs, so she just asks I'm responsible and honest. I went from getting high 2 or 3 times a week to maybe 2 or 3 times a month, if that. I also don't quite have the same routine as I now wait for what is my ""Saturday night"" off from work, but her ""Sunday."" That way I can still spend most my evenings with her. I have one night I can stay up late and have the big TV to myself, to watch whatever I want. I'm more of a geek than my wife and she isn't a fan of movies in general. 

I have the one night to myself, but I get so tired so much sooner lately, which is feeding into and off of an increase in anxiety and depression lately. I honestly am barely able to male it through one movie before falling asleep. It's not as much fun as it used to be as a result and since I don't have any close friends to talk to about all the great stuff I've been watching, I now sometimes just feel bummed out whenever I find a new show or movie I wanna check out. I have no way to continue the enjoyment, by sharing it with like-minded people after the fact, so I at least appreciate these things more, in the moment, because I am more receptive while high. More appreciative. I'm open to other alternatives to deal with my A&D, but therapy is expensive and not always effective for me. I'm struggling to find my sense of identity and while I don't want Middle Aged Stoner to be my personality, I do feel like it is a part of me and it has helped color in some vital shades of who I am.

I'm curious if most of you recommend using edibles to help handle anxiety or depression. I know this could be a sensitive topic and I am aware that it could be east to make accusations. Any such unnecessary toxic reactions, rather than legitimate empathy, will just get you blocked. I don't need bullshit at the moment. Safe spaces and whatnot.",1669942204.0

 It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
 Packed in every store

 At your own front door.

 They’ll be coming to visit and soon you will fidget  
 You can’t stand any of them;  
 You’re tired of talk and go for a walk  
 In the hope of buying some Gin;  
 And Mom and Dad can’t find you and they wonder where you’ve been.

 It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
 Everywhere you go;  
 Can’t find a cheap hotel, parking is really hell,  
 The shopping crowds, yeah they really blow.

I have been going counselling and at the time it feels great to get everything off my chest but as soon as a couple days past I start to feel anxious again.

I know the manager at this new job, known her for years and I know she is lovely she has put me in 1 day in 1 day out, so I don't get to overwhelmed (still am). I've gone from a 2 day a week job to a 4 and just have a sense of dread of not having enough time to do the stuff that makes me happy aka see my partner, play video games etc.

with this job though it has a lot riding on it I can finally earn enough money to move out of home with my partner of 10 years (he has been waiting and waiting for me to get a job so that we can do that) it's an assistant manager position and eventually can become a manager in 5-6 years time it will create some routine in my life.

how do I stop feeling so petrified and have the feeling of dread everytime I think about monday? 

I know I am not the only person in the world that feels like this but right now it feels like I am its horrible.

When I was off work I had no anxiety I felt my self again but as soon as I got the job etc the feelings started creeping up again.

Our head is foggy; our thoughts never quite finishing themselves. Searching for an answer to a question, or trying to remember how to do something we do daily, like making a cup of tea, can feel like mentally wading through treacle. Our eyes sting and keep trying to close. We might have a piercing headache. Every single one of our muscles ache, including muscles we didn’t even know we had. 

Having an understanding of the things that might be contributing to our tiredness can help us to be a little kinder to ourselves. Our tiredness isn’t a sign of weakness – it’s our body’s natural response to long-standing anxiety.

With anxiety, it can sometimes take a little bit of trial and error to find the things that work for us – because we’re all different, we all have different triggers and respond to the world around us in different ways.

He refused to take me to a doctor and in the end, my daughter (17 at the time) haf to take care of me. My husband was an arrogant asshole the entire time and I've never forgiven him for it. I've been having counselling since and have been diagnosed with PTSD (on top of the anxiety disorderi have already). I have also been left with chronic gut problems and pain as a result of the strainof covid I had. I've had my vaccines but started to feel unwell on Sunday, found an LFT and I tested positive. 
I panicked. Husband lectured me that it's ""just a head cold now"" and I needed to calm down. Before I knew it, I was sobbing and in a massive state. I'm absolutely terrified it's going to do to me what it did last time. I'm fluey and was very achy, but that's passing. However I had IBS last night and since then, I've been totally panicked.

But if it isn’t my anxiety stopping me from doing the things I want to do it’s the voice in the back of my head saying I’m not good enough. It’s not like I’ve never felt happy or carefree but it’s always so fleeting, someone might tell a joke and in the moment I’m laughing, enjoying myself but then the voice in the back  of my head tells me I look ugly doing that or it wasn’t that funny you’ll come across as weird or how I’ve always had ugly teeth or whatever…. 

My fear of abandonment gets in the way, I lash out, push people away or just avoid them, I try to stop doing that and the voice reminds me of how shit I’ve been in the past or tells me no one could really like me. 

I’ll try to push myself end up doing too much or I’m not doing enough. I don’t even know who I am as a person. I’ve never thought I was good enough but now I think about how I’ve been in the past I used to be a book worm and love theatre, I still do but I find it hard to do anything or have hobbies.

I feel generally happier on cymbalta after trying 10 or so other medications, mainly for anxiety, but noticed no change on anything else. I only recently realized I have depression and that’s likely where a lot of my physical and mental symptoms have stemmed. The cymbalta has made me less irritable and way fewer suicide ideation “jokes”. My anxiety has chilled out noticeably too. Is it worth it to keep taking cymbalta and risk the withdrawal effects (that I very recently learned can be extreme) or should I just stop now before my body is dependent?

I am well aware that things that I might not expect can set it off in her, and for the most part, I am able to ignore my feelings and be there to support her when she has a flare up.

However, she is currently going through a rather bad bout since yesterday - it seemingly came out of nowhere, and she has responded by retreating into herself more than normal; barely saying a word to me, leaning in for hugs a lot more and holding me for longer, going to bed without telling me and facing away from me in bed then falling asleep without even saying ""goodnight"".  I have asked if she is OK and the response I got was a flippant ""I have a lot going on right now, please just leave it"".  When I ask if she can at least let me know if it is anything I can help with she very decisively states ""you can't help me"".

So there we have it - she is completely retreating emotionally and physically (she only EVER initiates any contact when SHE wants it, if I reach for her hand she pulls it away, if I hug her, she won't reciprocate (arms stay resolutely at her sides), and when I ask her what is going on, I am shut down entirely.  It may seem dramatic to say but the past 24 hours I have felt more alone despite being married than I ever felt when I was single.  I have tried to talk to her and as I said above, I get shut down and dismissed as not being able to help her.  I feel alone, worried about her and inadequate (the last one due to the ""you can't help"" comment).  I am aware though, that I should not be focussing on how I feel right now and trying to help her through this, but without knowing what is bothering her I can't do anything.  Has anyone managed to navigate this?

And from out of nowhere, there's a guy (coworker?) whispering to one of my male customers that if he puts in an application, he'll make three times what I make and that freaks me out too.

Then it abruptly shifted to me trying to clock out, but the time clock wasn't working and GM tells me NOBODY is leaving until the time clock gets fixed, which I'm like, ""What?

Sorry for formatting, I’m on mobile.

I’ve (F28) found myself awake and in a panic just 2 hours after finally falling asleep (it is currently around 6:25am where I’m located). 

I’ve been having some mental health issues for a while now, some pretty intense depression, anxiety, PMDD, C-PTSD, all tons of fun when coupled with lifelong insomnia. My Dr. has prescribed me Setraline (Zoloft) that I’ve worked up to 125mg from 50mg over the last month, with the intention of going a bit higher. I also started Hydroxyzine (Atarax) 25mg that I can take up to three times a day for anxiety as well as insomnia at night (though I’ve found it’s not very effective for the type of anxiety I have and often take it just once to help with the insomnia). Most recently Prazosin (2mg) was added to the mix to help with the nightmares.

 I began taking the Prazosin 2 nights ago and just woke up from a HORRIBLE, vivid nightmare worse than anything I’ve had in months. I’m used to weird, lucid-type dreams, sleep paralysis, and nightmares that wake me up in a panicked cold sweat. This was a different animal and even had a sort of inception-y nightmare within a nightmare aspect. Would not recommend.

I’m wondering if anyone else has had a similar reaction. I actually have a call with my Dr. in a few hours anyway, so of course I’ll mention it to her, but I just can’t stop wondering wtf is wrong with my brain. War Vets who have seriously terrifying PTSD can be helped by this but I, someone who has been lucky to never see combat or anything close to it, get worse? I’d really just love to hear anyone’s take on this; please send any questions, comments or recommendations my way!

773,It's not the serotonin,3,z63jqg,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/z63jqg/its_not_the_serotonin/,4,"I've been depressed my whole life. Also social anxiety sufferer. I've been to many p-docs in the pasts, and all they've done for me was prescribing SSRIs one after another seeing that they don't have any effect on me, no side effects, or absolutely not a single withdrawal when I stop them CT.

So, IT'S NOT the serotonin. Why doctors believe that the root of anxiety and depression is serotonin ?

Tramadol helps me. It's an opioid, a serotonin releaser, an SRI and an NRI. It helps me, well it helped me when tolerance was low. Why doctors don't look another causes ? (Like Dopamine deficiency for instance ? Pramipexole can work wonders for some people, as it steadily rises dopamine (in nucleus accumbens I think, it's a dopamine D2 agonist)/ Like underworking endorphin system or endorphins deficinecy ? Clearly, even on the weakest opioids I feel 100% normal. My anxiety vanishes better than benzos. I feel normal on them, not high. That means my brain craves dopamine or endorphins. Buprenorphine which is a partial opioid agonist is being studied for its antidepressant action. And for most people works amazing for the first 1 or 2 years on it, especially when given in the lowest possible doses.

Buprenorphine given in someone with zero tolerance will probably make him nod or puke, but with little tolerance or introducing it in your system with trace amounts it can be such an amazing tool for depression and anxiety, and I hope it gets approved so psychiatrists can prescribe it. Buprenorphine, apart from being a partial opioid agonist, is a kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. Agonism of kappa-receptor causes dysphoria. So, antagonizing the kappa-receptor can make day/night different in someone's mood.

I've decided to go again after years to a p-doc again, and I went a few days ago, just to talk, to see if there's any new med out there to help me. He prescribed me fluoxetine.

Hopefully I’m not getting too annoying. So, bit of background. My Italian boyfriend (41) and me (32) split a few days ago. I’m abroad visiting my family and he called to say it wasn’t working. He was signed off work for severe anxiety the same day. He said his head was about to explode with everything so he had to reset. We’d been together 3 years and this is the third time he’s split, saying that he’s not fulfilled sexually. The communication throughout has been awful – he’s only ever told me he’s not happy sexually to leave me, never to find a possible solution to the problem. It is true that towards the end of our relationship we were only having sex once every 10 days ish, although we have had more during our relationship. When he left me, he was crying saying how he loved me and didn’t want to lose me. A bit more background… he came out the closet about 4 years ago to the horror of his parents, who never accepted me. He has diagnosed depression, takes pills for anxiety and his therapist says he has severe dependency on his mother (who the therapist says he is “married” to). His mother is really miserable and hates me. I am his first partner, and his sister who is nearing 50 has never had a partner. Also, basically every area of his life seems to cause him deep unsatisfaction, which is really striking for me. Anyhow, last night, we were speaking on WhatsApp and then he called, crying. He said he was so sorry for leaving me over the phone and that he is going through a really rough patch in his life, but that I mean the world to him. He said he hasn’t been satisfied with our sex from day 1, sees everything we did together (including our trips) through a filter of sadness, and that his mother has said that we didn’t love each other anyone and that I could never make him happy. He also said that he knows some people are ok with a relationship which makes each person feel secure, provides them with a stable family environment, and where there is commitment, but where the sex is not 101%, and he doesn’t want that. There was lots of crying and we talked about maybe giving it one more try, but he said he’ll have to speak with his therapist first tomorrow. Anyway, my question is, I know it might not work out, and I’m not looking for people to tell me it won’t, but if we do decide to give it one last go, what change could we make to maximize our chances of success? We both love each other lots and get on well. Each time we got back together, we’ve never changed anything, just hoping for a different outcome, which I think has been a mistake. I’d be eternally grateful for any advice 😊.",1669577517.0

My depression

I'm very depressed. I don't have any purpose in life, and I'm not sure why. I think that's probably because of my depression.

I don't know how to face my depression. It's hard to explain why you're so sad all the time, but some things make it easier:

\*Writing down your feelings is helpful because it forces you to put things into words, which makes them more real.

\*Talking about how you feel with someone else helps too, but it can be hard when your only friend is your computer (and then it's just an email conversation).

\*Reading about other people's experiences can be helpful too - if nothing else it might give you a better idea of what to expect from depression in the future.

People will always make fun of you, they will always blame you, they will always attack you, they will make you feel powerless, and they will constantly try to break down your self-esteem. But there is one thing they can never take away from you: your mind. You can be your hero. Don't let the sins of the world steal your peace, steal your joy, suppress your personality and damage your mind so that you can never recover it as it was before.",1669467543.0

I didnt get confort or help from anyone not even from friends that i thought we shared a brotherhood with them (fuck all this fake ass’s friends), that was the reason i found my self dragging to addiction and isolation trying to get the support that i needed but unfortunately that only make things worst..

I was lost, so lost in my thoughts ,starting to have doubts about myself ,my capability,the meaning of my life, my future, my existence , I was mad so fkn mad, hatred and loneliness was consuming me. Couldn't do anything at the moment besides smoking my pain away.

Couple years passed, Lost more than 95% of my fake friends, let the door open for few new people some of them helps me and listened to me when i need it , so now they are friends that i can relate on them.

I started the healing process, but i still feel the sadness and emptiness inside me its like a cancer. I am trying to keep good habits ( going to the gym, cook, activities outdoor, reading..) but i have the lack of motivation and lack of pleasure doing things. 

I made a list with the things, goals and that I wanna achieve in the short,mid,long term future,and i know that only me, myself,and i how to make that happen and no one else.

I wake up freezing because I'm covered in sweat. Tonight's dream was especially bad. It made no sense, like lots of dreams, but I was panicked in it and when I woke up. 

I've been going to the gym, journaling, trying to be aware of the language I'm using with myself. But these dreams are out of my control and are starting to become a real problem. I'm hoping that since I've dropped back down to 40mg they will eventually go away. But it's been a few weeks and I'm still waking up every night.

Something else in me is super jealous when they hang out with other people, I want them for myself and I can't integrate myself into friend groups very well at all.

I don't know why I'm like this. When we get to hang out, it's a fun time. But even just one day afterwards, the doubts start to amass again.

I've struggled with anxiety and depression my entire life. As of approximately June, I pretty much formally became an adult - fully supporting myself financially, living on my own and working full time. I had a very difficult time finding a job that pays enough for me to survive though and I was from a multitude of jobs before finding something stable. Supporting myself was a major transition for me as i grew up financially spoiled. I've struggled with some strange health issues over the years which doctors haven't been able to diagnose. My hands went numb for 6 months, extreme back pain, chronic pain in my left arm, heat flashes, tremors. I've gone to countless doctors. In around June the symptoms came back with full force. At some point in July while I was driving under severe stress, i tried to speak out loud to my mom while talking on the phone when i somehow tricked myself into thinking i couldn't speak. Thus ensued a downward spiral. I started to experience a random conglomerate of uncomfortable thoughts and feelings which genuinely led me to believe I was developing schizophrenia. I saw my psychiatrist who said i have extreme anxiety. I did not believe him so I checked myself into the hospital and got myself admitted only to be told the same exact thing by the doctor at the mental institution. I got on medication for a solid 3 days and the panic went away, but then the medication caused me to lose my inner monologue. Basically the auditory effect that my and your and most peoples thoughts have totally went away - i cannot explain it to anyone. I immediately got off the medication and resumed normal life for several months. Then about a month ago something strange started to happen. I began to believe I had once again lost my internal monologue. For about a week I was in a state of shock and panic. I got on medication again, a different one this time and eventually the intense fear that rendered me completely useless dwindled to something a bit more mild - but still i am living in constant fear. Like i said i've always had anxiety but whatever it has developed into since June has been truly concerning to me.",1669086080.0

It wasn’t always like this. I used to get excited to go to work and I was kind and I focused on my kids and yes I had stress but it was “normal” stress.

It’s now way past my bed time to not be tired for work tomorrow but I’m scared to go to bed because that means I’ll wake up tomorrow and have to go to work.

It’s not all my classes at all. Most of my kids are absolutely amazing and incredible students. But I have trouble giving them what they deserve because the few who make my day miserable take up so much of my patience, my energy, my tolerance… my kindness.

It’s even making me question whether I even like kids at all. If I even want kids of my own one day (and I’ve wanted kids my whole life and I’m a 31 female and the time is ticking).

How can I stay in this job another 3-4 years to benefit from all my schooling and my working my way up the pay grid?

I want to share a story. I was struggling with a generalized anxiety disorder for a few years. It influenced my life dramatically, unfortunately, cause you can't calm down. At all. At some moment after the crazy 2020 I discovered that it's impossible to continue that way... so I worked with a therapist and collected tools for daily recovery. And it worked. I developed a habit of DAILY anxiety relief and now, in 2022 my husband sees the difference between these two versions of myself. I have more energy and calmness at the same moment. I am just much more happier now...

After coping with my own problem I teamed up with professionals and CBT psychologists to create an anxiety relief app for women. It helps manage thoughts, emotions, and behavior with self-care rituals and CBT tools. The habit of daily anxiety relief boosts the progression in any other sphere, cause you have just more free 'space' in your mind...

I'm looking for people who would like to try the app (just iOS) and give me feedback (15 min texting in the messenger). If someone is ready to help me and try new ways of anxiety relief, I'll provide FREE access to the app as a gift. Just let me know in the comments.

Being on medication has helped tremendously, but it’s always still THERE. Like it’s never truly gone. I go to work and I work with customers and at a hospital. I have to greet and thank them for their purchase and just be so happy all the time. I’m getting tired of being treated like shit from the rude and ungrateful ones that come through. And it effects me how Im treated, thus, I take it personally and then it’s affecting me mentally. I’ve been doing this job for 4 years, but it feels like forever. Plus just reflecting on how I thought it was possible to make and have real friends that I work with. Hell no, it’s not as I’ve learned. A lot of it is they want your attention so bad and once they got it they don’t reciprocate and make the effort for a friendship. It’s really made me sad because I feel like I haven’t had a real friendship and connection with somebody in a long time. Honestly, I’ve got two friends and I’d really love to have more.

I won't say his name I'll just say bob. Me and Bob lived two streets away from each other We did the usual kid stuff growing up, round each other's houses, playing in the park, walking to school together. Bob was a bit weird but I just thought he was a bit of an outsider and that was fine as I was so I wouldn't judge people. The thing that stood out was that he was really weird with his two younger sisters, he was overprotective but he also made some weird comments about them at times. Talking about when they grow up and periods and stuff like that. This should have been red flags to me but I was young and didn't know. He used to play in the small park right next to his house and play with his sisters and their friends a lot but this turned out to be grooming of two of their friends. I never saw him touch anyone or anything like that but I would have stopped that right away. I just wish I said something to his parents or mine about his weird comments he made about his sisters because looking back now it was more like sexualisation of them, which would have then got him sorted and stopped it from happening and I regret I missed all the signs as I could have stopped him ruining two girls lives. He has been sentenced to 10 years for what he did but I regret that I could have stopped it happening if I just paid more attention. This has been eating at me since I found out and I feel like I should have said something to his or my own parents and maybe stopped it from happening.

Just for classes. I burned myself out in high school and after that it’s never really been the same. I struggle to find and maintain passion for almost anything. Last year I finally got better. I started applying myself more and I did really really well. Now that I’m back in this position, I almost feel worse. How could I let this happen again? And why can’t I stop it? 

I’m not failing or anything, I study the material so I still manage to do well— I’m actually set to graduate this December! But still I feel like I’ve learned hardly anything from my classes. I have a degree I don’t know how to use. A lot of my peers are very respectable people and I feel guilty to have the same degree as them when they’ve done so much more to earn it.

850,My boyfriend of 10 months broke up with me unexpectedly,9,yvrycl,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/yvrycl/my_boyfriend_of_10_months_broke_up_with_me/,1,"Yeah, title says everything. I’ve posted here before about a emotionally abusive relationship I have been in for a year.  I got out of that and eventually met a wonderful man. I thought he was everything. I welcomed him into my life, introduced him to my family and my childhood dog. He attended my graduation, drove with me home from college, and met all my friends. I met his family and was set to join them in Vegas.

Then thjbgs got weird. He seemed more distant. He had a serious fall at his work and things got even weirder. During this time my younger pup got sick and had to spend a day in the hospital. He was there with me the entire time as I cried in the parking lot waiting for them to discharge her. We had a couples costume ready which we set ip. Went shopping for the props that Tuesday. I asked for us to talk about the weird thing going on. He breaks up with me in the car. I feel I dissociated in that moment as I can barely remember anything. He said our relationship had hit its expiration date. I had no idea anything was wrong. 

I had to endure a 45 minute car ride with him home as I cried the entire time   I went to his house the next day as I thought our spat was temporary. There he tells me he wants to stay on a break. He felt we were too different, he wants kids and thought we weren’t compatible (I want kids which confused me). He tells me that he canceled my ticket to Vegas. He said he would get back to me when he gets back. 

Now this is where I went wrong. I shouldn’t have ever waited for him.  He partied in Vegas for 5 days while I cried and waited for his decision, he never checked on me once. But I loved him and gave him space. I had time to think about everything going on and remembered how distant he was at the Halloween party. He chose to not sit with me. He drank so much and insisted I drink despite my hesitance. I decide to go to my friends house two states away after car break up. While I am there he says coldly “I don’t want to be in a relationship with you”. He said he couldn’t see himself having children with me. I was so hurt, we were okay a week prior and then he comes with bombshell. We talked again with my friend and he tells me he fell out of love. He didn’t love me anymore and came to that realization a week before. He couldn’t say anymore, he didn’t love me anymore. 

I wasn’t happy with this. We had been together for nearly a year. We spent many trips together, he helped me take care of my dogs whom are my life. My family welcomed with wide arms.  How could he just wake up and say he doesn’t love me. I demanded he talk to me in person and now I’m regretting this. I just opened up all the wounds again. I’m proud of myself for being persistent in getting an answer. But it hurts more that he had been irritated with me for the past month and a half.  He never once told me and acted like everything was fine. He told me he loved me even though he didn’t. Eve thing I did was as annoying and he had to fight not yell at me. Instead of coming to me with these problems, he breaks up with me. He told me that I’m a hypocrite, I’m rude, I’m petty, and my lateness was unacceptable. He told me I hurt his feelings even though I had no idea. He couldn’t think of an example.  He was angry as he listed these things off, he said my personality was something he didn’t want a long term relationship with.  He said he was an asshole for the way he handles this by breaking up with me suddenly.  As we talked I said that he was a shitty person for not talking to me about anything of this  and for leading me on and for saying I wasn’t worthy of having kids with knowing this was a sensitive topic. He wanted to be friends but I said I couldn’t. He says that he made a mistake and that our relationship could’ve been saved if he had just communicated. 

I am so unbelievably hurt. I thought I had finally found someone who cared about me. I told him about my abusive ex but he literally did the same thing by breaking up with me in the same way.  I was so afraid of annoying him. I tried to trust him, not make assumptions as I had tried in therapy. I’m struggling to eat or sleep, I’m in so much pain. It’s winter and the weather has been impacting my mood.  He continued  to sleep with me when he couldn’t stand me, tell me he loved me so convince me to have sex. It hurts me so much as I feel used. It’s been a long and horrible year as this is the 3rd relationship I have lost(my two close friends left). I messed up my medical school committee letter, I got sick.

Change is commonplace

But when you are routine based

Then change

will make you slip

They say to get a grip

Its hard with numb fingertips

Brace

for upside down

Assess the damage

Wrap your arm in a bandage

To that pavement

I’ll always be bound

**Chorus**

When Manhattan is 150 ft square feet

Taking off your blanket is no small feat

I’ll never show my friends

Silent songs are discreet

Push it all down

Feel burns but grit your teeth

Fighting through pain

To bring back what’s underneath

More like bum-on-the-couch

But fucked up nerves

Will turn your life around

Objects in motion vs immovable forces

Can’t take those years back

Overzealous meets codependent jealous

You stopped me in my tracks

&#x200B;

Broken spirit, hollow shell

Free time was personal hell

Frustration grows resent builds

Somehow always under your spell

&#x200B;

Digging tunnels, moving forward

seeking diamonds, finding coal

Turn around drown out your words

See the light but feel your curse

&#x200B;

Badly burned, passion starts to return

But love still feels like a fable

Isolation makes anxiety churn

Should normalcy be unobtainable?

&#x200B;

I search too much, drinks, banter then I start to crush

No comfort on my own so I rush

Force vibes, romanticize

You bite your lip and hide your blush

&#x200B;

Close gates when things are mutual

Growing cold gets old,

No one to mend my bruised soul

Can’t bare my heart anymore

Royal flush and I fold

&#x200B;

Digging tunnels, moving forward

seeking diamonds, finding coal

Turn around drown out your words

See the light but feel your curse

Badly burned, passion starts to return

But love still feels like a fable

Isolation makes anxiety churn

Should normalcy be unobtainable?

**House of Cards**

When you recognize signs but anxious minds don’t communicate

Hearts turn to black spades,

Mixed signals are rogue waves

Minced words dig their own graves

A house of cards falls

if it lacks foundation

But a king needs a queen

So I smile, wave, and fake it

&#x200B;

Self medication

Lung smoke halts my minds racing

I light a bowl, scroll and know I can deal with that later

&#x200B;

No time like the present

To turn dark thoughts fluorescent

This kingdom is mine

If I reach out and take it

&#x200B;

Self awareness is a blessing

But constant second guessing

Needlessly addressing and stressing

Just take a breath, please

&#x200B;

No pre-meditation

Walk before running the paces

Reflect on the here and now

Then have conversations

&#x200B;

No time like the present

To turn dark thoughts fluorescent

This kingdom is mine

If I reach out and take it

&#x200B;

A house of cards falls

if it lacks foundation

The kingdom can wait

Take life as it comes and savor it",1668360101.0

885,How Using Hapbee Can Help Replace Chemical Sleep Aids,1,ys7kl3,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/ys7kl3/how_using_hapbee_can_help_replace_chemical_sleep/,1," 

It started innocently enough: a  little nightcap here, a little melatonin there. But before you know it,  you are faced with the realization that you’re reaching for a little  help to get to sleep most nights of the week. And when you don’t, you’re  spending most of your twilight hours tossing and turning, wondering if  it’s “too late” to take something now because you’ll end up feeling  groggy with a head full of cobwebs when your alarm goes off.

According to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6849a5.htm?s_cid=mm6849a5_w#suggestedcitation),  8.2% of American adults reported using a sleep aid at least four times  in the last week — that’s more than half the time they lay their head  down on a pillow!

**What’s So Bad About Chemical Sleep Aids?**

Sleep aids fall into one of several  categories, including prescription medications, over-the-counter  products, alcohol, and dietary supplements. Let’s explore the hidden  dangers of each:

**Prescription sleeping pills:** Remember  when your physician prescribed that bottle of Ambien and you swore to  yourself you’d only take it on nights where it was *really*  crucial to get some sleep (like before a big meeting or taking a long  road trip)? Take a look inside that bottle to count how many of those  little pills are left. Perhaps you’re leaning on this crutch a little  too often?

This powerful sedative is only  supposed to be used for short-term sleep disturbances, yet many people  have become hooked on it long-term. Those who have a longstanding habit  may experience a host of side effects, including dry mouth, depression,  hallucinations, anxiety, recurrent headaches, dizziness, and poor motor  coordination. Eventually, your tolerance will build up, which means  you’ll require a higher dose to achieve the same effects. 

**Melatonin:** You may have heard  that melatonin is natural, and therefore is safe to take. And that’s  partially true: Melatonin is a hormone produced by the pineal gland in  the brain that naturally occurs in response to darkness, which helps  with the timing of your circadian rhythm (your internal 24-hour clock).  That’s why melatonin is often helpful for reducing the symptoms  associated jet lag, shift work, and for those diagnosed with Delayed  Sleep-Wake Phase Disorder (a circadian rhythm disorder). 

Melatonin supplements are  synthetically created, and commonly reported side effects include  daytime drowsiness, headaches, and dizziness. What’s more, its  effectiveness is questionable at best. According to the [American Academy of Sleep Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5263087/),  there’s isn’t enough sufficient scientific support to conclude that  melatonin actually helps reduce insomnia (and most people who take it  are using it to treat their self-diagnosed insomnia). 

**Other over-the-counter sleeping pills:** If  you’ve ever reached for such over-the-counter medications as Benadryl,  Tylenol PM, ZzzQuil, or Unisom to help get a little shut-eye, then know  this seemingly harmless habit is a slippery slope. 

First, even though these products  don’t require a prescription, these medications come with side effects,  ranging from dizziness and strange dreams to daytime drowsiness and dry  mouth. They could also negatively interact with your prescription  medications. And the [FDA](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug-safety-and-availability/fda-warns-about-serious-problems-high-doses-allergy-medicine-diphenhydramine-benadryl#:~:text=The%20U.S.%20Food%20and%20Drug,%2C%20coma%2C%20or%20even%20death.) warns that Benadryl, in particular, has been linked to serious heart problems, seizures, coma, and even death.

**Alcohol:** Have you grown  accustomed to a few glasses of wine or a couple cocktails to help take  the edge off before bedtime? According to the [Sleep Foundation](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/nutrition/alcohol-and-sleep),  alcohol is a central nervous system depressant that causes brain  activity to slow down — which is why it helps induce relaxation and  sleepiness. 

While you might think that a few  cocktails help you sleep better, in truth, that sedative effect doesn’t  last long after initially helping you fall asleep. In fact, alcohol has  been linked to poor sleep quality and duration. Not to mention that  people who frequently rely on alcohol may be more likely to experience  insomnia and it can exacerbate the symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea  (which will also keep you up). Furthermore, a [2018 study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29549064/)  revealed that even low amounts of alcohol (read: fewer than two  servings a day for men and one serving a day for women) decreased sleep  quality by 9.3%. Finally, alcohol can suppress REM sleep during the  first two cycles.

**Hapbee Is Here to Help Break the Habit**

Hapbee emits ultra-low energy signals  that are recorded from a molecule’s magnetic frequency. And these  signals replicate the natural effects of specific compounds — like the  energy from caffeine or the relaxation you get from a sleep aid, like  Ambien or melatonin. 

But unlike these chemical sleep aids, Hapbee Signals are designed to take effect quickly *and*  wear off right after you end your session because there are no  substances for your body to eliminate. That means you won’t experience  any long-lasting effects, like grogginess, brain fog or addiction, but  you will experience everything that *seems* to be great about the aforementioned sleep aids.

By using the Sleep Signals and Blends  at bedtime, Hapbee customers have reported less difficulty falling  asleep, a more relaxed mental state, and [restorative power naps](https://hapbee.com/blogs/hapbee/8-tips-for-putting-the-power-back-in-power-naps) . 

For instance, Wind Down is a blend of  adenosine (one of the major sleep triggers) and melatonin that’ll help  calm your thoughts and muscles so you can ease into sleep. The Deep  Sleep Blend is engineered from melatonin, and perfect for light sleepers  who often awaken in the middle of the night. Power Nap blends adenosine  and CBD, which will allow you doze off for a quick recharge. And  Winter’s Nap is engineered from melatonin and CBD to allow you to awaken  refreshed.",1668165630.0
886,Breaking the Stress-Sleep Cycle with Hapbee,1,ys7iqs,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/ys7iqs/breaking_the_stresssleep_cycle_with_hapbee/,4,"  

How do you cope with stress? Do  you fall prey to stress-snack cycles? Stress-three-glasses-of-wine  cycles? Do you find yourself stuck in stress-pimple cycles or  stress-migraine cycles? What about  stress-argue-with-your-significant-other-over-mundane-things cycles? 

Yeah, we aren’t saying it’s  necessarily pretty, but there are plenty of ways to deal with stress —  and if you don’t find a healthy coping mechanism (more on that, shortly,  because this is where Hapbee really shines), your body will find  less-than-pleasant ways to deal with it for you. 

**Shocking Sleep-Stress Statistics** 

And what about sleep? Yes, for many, stress negatively impacts sleep. Take a look at these notable stats, found in an [American Psychological Association study](https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2013/sleep):

&#x200B;

* 42 percent of adults report that their sleep quality is fair or poor.
* 43 percent report that stress has caused them to lie awake at night in the past month. 
* 45 percent feel even more stressed if they don’t get enough sleep.
* Adults  with lower reported stress levels report sleeping more hours a night  than adults with higher reported stress levels (7.1 hours vs. 6.2  hours).
* Adults with high stress are more likely to say they are not getting enough sleep because their minds race.

Furthermore, the study revealed that  adults who sleep fewer than eight hours a night are more likely to  report symptoms of stress in the past month, such as:

&#x200B;

* feeling irritable or angry (45 percent vs. 32 percent of adults),
* feeling overwhelmed (40 percent vs. 27 percent),
* lacking interest, motivation or energy (42 percent vs. 30 percent),
* losing patience or yelling at their children (52 percent vs. 27 percent),
* losing patience or yelling at their spouse or partner (50 percent vs. 36 percent), and
* skipping exercise (41 percent vs. 33 percent).

So it shouldn’t come as a surprise that there’s an actual medical term for this phenomenon: [the sleep-stress cycle](https://hapbee.com/blogs/hapbee/why-managing-stress-will-lead-to-a-better-night-s-sleep).

**What is the Sleep-Stress Cycle?**

According to [Sleep.org](https://www.sleep.org/how-sleep-works/sleep-and-stress/),  stress and sleep have a reciprocal relationship whereby high levels of  stress can contribute to trouble sleeping, and poor-quality or  insufficient sleep. Conversely, chronic stress, the kind you experience  long-term, also affects your sleep-wake cycle, or the internal clock  that tells your body when it’s time to be alert and when it’s time to  rest.

So if you’ve ever felt stuck in a  loop of being so stressed that all you want to do is sleep, but you  can’t sleep because you’re so stressed out, you know just how  frustrating and how real the sleep-stress cycle is. 

The main hormone to consider when  exploring the sleep-stress cycle is cortisol, the stress hormone. In a  perfect world, cortisol decreases at night, when you’re ready for sleep —  but people with insomnia often have higher levels in the evening. 

The ways in which stress can play out  are well-documented, including the reduction of deep sleep and rapid  eye movement (REM) sleep, increased muscle tension that makes it hard to  relax, an elevated heart rate and rapid breathing, and issues with the  digestive system that make it uncomfortable to rest.

**How Hapbee Helps You Cope with Stress So You Can Sleep Soundly**

As you can see, finding ways to help manage your chronic stress is crucial to you overall health *and* the key to [getting a great night’s sleep](https://hapbee.com/blogs/hapbee/how-to-build-the-perfect-bedtime-routine-for-a-great-night-s-sleep).  This is why so many people choose to lean on chemical substances — like  melatonin, sleeping pills, alcohol or cannabis/CBD — to get their  ZZZs. 

But one problem with these options is  that they can cause dependency issues, meaning you’ll need to take them  regularly, and often in increasing dosages, to feel the same effects.  Another concern is unwanted side effects, which could be anything from  weight gain and nightmares to depression and heart palpitations. Yet  another problem with these substances is that they usually only work for  a couple hours at best, leaving you wide awake in the middle of the  night and unable to fall back asleep without taking more. Finally, some  of these will even leave you groggy in the morning, which means you  won’t wake up feeling refreshed and recharged — and that will also  impact your stress response.

Hapbee was specifically designed to  replace all these aforementioned substances in a chemical-free and safe  way. How? The device is a wearable technology that uses a Signal — a  recording of a compound or molecule’s unique magnetic frequency, like  caffeine or melatonin — to emit these signals to your body’s receptors.  In turn, your body feels the positive impact (such as relaxation, calm  and sleepiness) without the side effects or dependency. 

These Signals include:

* Calm 
* Relax
* Deep Sleep
* Bedtime

Hapbee also has multiple Blends (a combination of different signals) geared toward relaxation and sleep, including: 

* Winter’s Nap: a blend of melatonin and CBD
* Wind Down: a blend of melatonin and adenosine
* Bedtime: a blend of adenosine
* Deep Sleep: a blend of melatonin
* [Power Nap](https://hapbee.com/blogs/hapbee/8-tips-for-putting-the-power-back-in-power-naps): a blend of adenosine and CBD 
* Time to Lounge: a blend of CBD",1668165456.0

I ended up in the ER that night because my legs and hands started shaking profusely, my whole body hunched over. I've been on a sick leave from work to try to deal with the waves of anxiety (maybe 2 days out of the week are good, 5-6 days I'll have constant anxiety) and gone through therapy, which helps on the better days but I don't feel all this talk about ""self acceptance"", ""meditation"" and ""not letting your mind control you"" helps when the pain is so unbearable.

Backstory: my husband and I have been together 17 years. In July, I gave birth to our second son. Six days before my son was born, our dog of 11 years passed away. With all of this change my husband had a “mental break”. He ended up not sleeping for weeks, and went from cycles of mania to crying all the time to fits of rage. The rage was so bad that I left with my two boys three weeks after my son was born for a week. He has had been going to therapy weekly, has had his medication adjusted, and we do couples therapy every other week. He has since pretty much come out of his manic state, and hasn’t been enraged. He is also sleeping a little bit better, but his depression is terrible. He is so distant and all he does is cry and post online and talk about our deceased dog. We are supposed to be bringing home a puppy this weekend in hopes that helps bring him a little out of his “hole”. While it is hard to watch him like this, it angers me too. I know that sounds selfish but I have suffered with depression and anxiety for years and I am the one who had a baby and I am the one who had been pretty much solo parenting since my son was born since he has not been mentally able to do anything. It also hurts because he was such a patient attentive father to our first son who is not five and with our three month old he has barely helped or bonded with him at all. He always says he “was born at a price” thinking that the dog had to die for the baby to be born. He is also a business owner and has been stressed and depressed about work, so I have been handling all of the housework and
Mental load for a long time to take it off of his plate. Am I being selfish for feeling this way? Am I enabling him? Am I just supposed to watch him be distant and cry about work and the dog for I don’t know how long I’m just supposed to watch him cry about the dog (who was
Mine as well) and totally ignore the fact we have a new baby and he’s missing out on people who are alive, while according to him the world stopped the day the dog died? I don’t know how to continue to be supportive without being resentful and angry and ANY advise would be appreciated.",1668044202.0

Why do some people go through trauma and abuse and others don’t? Why do some people have mental health problems and others don’t? Why do some people live the good life and others don’t? WHY!?

These questions also play a big part in my lack of faith in god. I tried really really hard to have faith in god. I started a journey a year ago and recently ended it because there’s so much that doesn’t make sense to, so much that seems unfair, and it was making my depression worse!

I was struggling from intense anxiety, and that led into depression. When I left for college the following august, I decided to better myself and quit doing the things that made me depressed.

Something that really helped was the absence of my parents. Their overbearing pressure was one of the major reasons I had anxiety in the first place.

Last weekend, I was drunk at a party. I put myself in a bad situation, so I deserved what happened to me. Before you say anything, I really don’t feel like talking about the details, so please just take my word that I deserved it.

Regardless, I got a mullet cut, which looks like ass. I’ve never had my hair shorter than maybe a 1/2” before, so I can’t pass it off as normal behavior. At least I’m a guy so at least it isn’t as socially taboo.

Anyways, I 100% regret what happened. I don’t want to have to tell my mom or dad what happened, but this is something I can’t hide. I guess the main thing is that I’m worried they are going to “crackdown” on me, and my relationship with them is going to deteriorate back to the way it was 2 years ago.

This whole scenario has thrown me into a funk, and I’m getting symptoms that I had two years ago. I’m tired, unmotivated, stressed (which I already had an unhealthy amount of on my plate), irritable, on edge, sad, angry, and so many other things.

I just don’t know what to do. I don’t have the mental capacity to deal with my parents being pissed at me on top of just day-to-day stress. I was just barely getting by before this and now I feel like I’m on the edge of a breakdown, or at least a regression back to that dark place from two years ago.

910,Anxiety of taking pills,3,yo27dz,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/yo27dz/anxiety_of_taking_pills/,4,"I, 22M, have been on Escitalopram for depression (no anxiety) with almost no side effects and prescribed Xanax for emergencies. After some time the escitalopram stopped working and I started taking paroxetine, which worsened my condition, and after a dose increase it completely messed me up and I had started tapering off of it. Even with the tapering process I became ill due to severe withdrawal symptoms which I suffered through for a week until I could get an appointment with my GP. The doctor claimed I have unexpectedly high susceptibility to this sort of medications (SSRIs) and dosage increase/tapering should be done more gradually than usual. So I started taking sertraline which helped my depression but made me nauseous (beyond the usual 2 weeks of normal side effects) and also, based on what other people told me, made me quite aggressive and irritable. So I went back to escitalopram, but a new psychiatrist that I decided to visit decided that I should go off escitalopram and start taking fluoexetine, he suggested I drop the 10 mg of escitalopram I was on (in the beginning I was at max dose of 20 mg) for two days and start the new drug, I explained what happened with the paroxetine and that I don't think I can go through this sort of extreme withdrawal again, so he suggested I taper off of it by taking 5 mg for 10 days, wait 2 days and then star the fluoexetine. Two days after I lowered the dose I became sick again, due to withdrawal (recognized it right away) and it was WAY worse than the first time, I was unable to function let alone go to work. I live alone and quite far from my parents, don't really have any close friends, and I was having non-stop crying fits and panic attacks, nausea, diarrhea even puked a couple of times due to stress. I tried to reach the psychiatrist but to no avail...I had to go back to my parents as I was afraid of harming myself, the psychiatrist answered my message a week later asking why I was even taking the escitalopram when he instructed me to take fluoexetine...I had a piece of paper with his instructions where what I previously wrote was clearly stated...I found a new and expensive psychiatrist and went to her for guidance and she suggested I take mirtazapine, but I couldn't do it. Every pill I take, even ones I took before (Xanax even) make me anxious to the point of panicking out of fear from having a bad reaction or even an allergic reaction (which I have only had for penicilin when I was 7, once), I never had anxiety before and even the Xanax was for when I feel extreme sadness and not for anxiety, so now I have anxiety too and I am afraid of taking the new pills and am kinda lost...Any suggestions on how to move forward from here will be appreciated. 
To be clear, when I realized the psychiatrist, who barely took family history from me and mocked me for the reason I was depressed during our meeting, didn't remember his own medication plan I didn't bother taking the fluoexetine and simply waited on 5 mg of escitalopram until my meeting with the new psychiatrist, which was today.",1667767598.0

He is currently on paliperidone for DMD, Pristiq for Depression, Lyrica for Anxiety. He also take B12, Vitamin D and Folic Acid.  He takes a small dose of Seroquel for sleep. On occasion he will get Ketmine IV when we see the depression is starting to take a downturn.  We have been trying every medication since he was in 1st grade - first for the ADHD, then when we realized how bad the anxiety was, we stopped those and started to treat the anxiety as primary. He took a Genesight test in 2016 which she is religious on referencing. He is just a really poor metabolizer and he as a difficult genetic make-up for medicating that which affects him. Something tells me there has to be something more and better out there for him, but she  keeps referring to the Genesight.  At one point she mentioned that he may also have RSD (Rejection Sensative Dysmorhoa) to which supposedly therapy is not good at treating and maybe we should try an MAOIs.

Today,
I’ve been feeling better lately, but still nervous around  people who aren’t mum and dad. Seeing/having to walk pass/talking to other people makes me nervous.

The sickness feeling is weird? It’s like my stomach is turning over multiple times, my mouth feels dry and I dig my fingers nails into my palm to try and not cry. I also lose my voice and I go very quiet and I feel as if I can’t talk. It makes it very hard to communicate with others and even when I try and push myself to speak it’s as if I can’t.

Being near other people makes me feel sick, so the only thing I can do is stay in my room and try and block everything out, the thoughts, the voices screaming at me and telling me I should be able to do simple things such as helping out. I wonder a lot why can’t I do the most normal things? To be honest nowadays I don’t even want to be happy the only thing I want now is to be at peace. 

I want to be able to think without asking myself why I didn’t do something right the first time, why was I taking too long to answer a question, did it make me look stupid? Does that perosn think I’m stupid? What does that other people think of me? Why did I stutter? Am I talking too much? Am I being too quiet? Why can’t I be a normal girl and do normal things? I’m never going to do anything with my life because I’m always feeling like this, if I can’t do simple tasks with someone near me how am I going to get through life? Why can’t I stop thinking too much? Does that perosn hate me? Do you hate me? Why aren’t you happy? No one will ever love you if you’re always like this, you’ll always have that lonely feeling with you, kill yourself already no one would miss you that much, you’re a burden to everyone else around you because you’re always like this, you’re a bother, stop being so annoying, no one will care about you truly so there’s no point in trying just accept this feeling forever, just sleep there’s no point in trying to keep doing anything.

Does anyone know how to stop theses thoughts? It’s feeling like they are choking me all the time.

“Trapped. 

Each day, I look in the mirror and see a complete stranger. I try to look harder, deeper into the strangers eyes. I see sadness. I see brokenness. I see someone barely holding on. I can hear her thoughts loudly whisper “what happened to me?” 

I want to hold her. I want to tell her it’s going to be okay. I want to remind this familiar stranger how strong she is. I want to tell her it’s okay to feel these things for now. It’s okay to go through it. It’s okay to mourn who she used to know. 

I reach out to touch her. But she pulls away quickly. She runs. Scared to face the truth and the pain. 

But I follow her and I watch her. I watch her from a distance daily. I watch her keep trying. Keep trying to complete the most menial of tasks. Keep trying to find joy in the things that once set her soul on fire. But nothing works. Not the gym or her job or her friends or her family. Not her favorite shows or movies. Not even her favorite food. She often forgets to even eat and when she does, it’s so mindless. Its all merely just attempted distractions now. It’s just full of intense worry yet paralyzing numbness all at once. I imagine it’s like being stuck under a crushing weight, knowing you are strong enough to push it off you but not caring enough to do it. I watch her stop for a moment or two each day and the thoughts whisper again “who are you….what happened to you?”

She finds comfort at home. When she can go to sleep. She prays tomorrow it’ll be different. The stranger will leave her. I pray with her. Her last loud thought before she drifts off to sleep….“why….why is my mind so mean to me?” 

It is the only peace she has all day, thanks to the sedation of the pill that helps her make it to the next sunrise full of distractions. 

And Im trapped. Trapped behind this heavy fog of complete poison but even so….I will try again tomorrow….to reach her, to hold her, to remind her…..I’ll try again. “",1667405786.0

948,Anxiety and Depression after quitting 20+ years of Alcohol Abuse.,10,yjh2kh,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/yjh2kh/anxiety_and_depression_after_quitting_20_years_of/,3," My  anxiety feels like a constant white noise of health concerns in my head  about my heart, lungs and brain with a volume knob that gets cranked up  and down throughout the day. I always feel like I'm moments away from a  panic attack that never happens.

I  have physical symptoms of muscle tension, heart palpitations (Diagnosed  harmless PVC's from a Cardiologist), jaw clenching and lots of  stimming/fidgeting.

I hate this. I  hate not being able to live my life how I want. I live in a limbo,  afraid to make commitments or plans. And the ones I do have weigh heavy  on my mind in the days prior. I worry I'll be miserable mentally  managing my anxiety instead of enjoying whatever the event or plans are.

I  feel like a person trying to live their life and pretend to be normal  while constantly wrestling with an invisible snake that is hell bent on  wrapping itself around my neck and suffocating me.

It's exhausting.

I  was a career alcoholic. 20+ years of drinking from my early teens into  my 40's. Last few years were daily 5ths of vodka type alcoholism. I am  now 19 months sober.

I began  having severe anxiety about 6 months before I quit, anxiety that alcohol  no longer numbed. For reasons of shame, guilt and self loathing, all  born from a traumatic past, I decided to quit cold turkey at home, not  telling anyone, not even my wife. It finally sank in that Alcohol wasn't  helping things.

During the first 2  or 3 days of abstaining, I believe I went into full delirium. I  experienced multiple panic attacks so severe, I felt like I was losing  my mind. I couldn't think, I couldn't move. I just ""Existed"" in a  terrifying state of feeling impending doom and hopelessness.

I  believe these episodes opened Pandora's box. I can't un-know that  feeling of out of mind panic. I stared into the abyss of madness and it  stared back at me. It's the fear of sliding back into that unstoppable  spiral of panic that drives a lot of my anxiety.

I've  been in Therapy for over a year now, and also see a Psychiatrist for  medication. I have an official diagnosis of General Anxiety Disorder and  Major Depressive Disorder.

I had a  good 2-3 months lately when, after being on Lexapro for 9 months with  marginal improvements, I asked my Psychologist to add Wellbutrin based  on family history. Once this was in my system with the Lexapro and  stabilized, I felt great.

It was  like all the white noise and worry in my head was gone. There was a  sense of serenity and peace in there I hadn't felt in more than a year.

Then,  foolishly, I tried quitting Lexapro (with my doctor's consent),  thinking Wellbutrin was the magic bullet. After tapering for a few  weeks, I quit completely off of 5mg.

Everything  was fine for about a month, just some brain zaps that weren't too bad.  But as soon as the brain zaps subsided after about 5 weeks, my anxiety  came roaring back. It was like someone grabbed the volume knob and  cranked it right back up.

I've started Lexapro again and I hope once it's back in my system fully, I can return to that peace and quiet in my head.

But for now, every day is spent wrestling with the mental serpent of anxiety while smiling and pretending everything is OK.",1667327876.0

952,Devastated and I can't stop spiraling,7,yjatip,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/yjatip/devastated_and_i_cant_stop_spiraling/,3,"Not sure why I'm writing this on Reddit. I guess I feel guilty being the Eeyore of my friend group right now.

I'm supposed to be on a vacation right now. As of typing this, I'm supposed to be 3-days into a beach vacation full of sunny vibes, island  cocktails and smiles. I am the complete opposite. My husband started  getting sick a week before we were supposed to leave. He was told he wasn't contagious. Two days before leaving, I start to get sick too. Now I have a terrible cough, junk in my chest, swollen lymph nodes, no voice and am in a deep depression.

This was going to be  our last vacation for a long time so we could save up for house repairs.  I planned our trip. I planned everything. I put everything into motion. In hindsight, this is a good and bad thing. I love planning trips  because I get excited about them. But at the same time, I'm a big people pleaser and I put a lot pressure on myself for things to go well otherwise it will be completely on me if things go wrong/mess up. Then if someone has a bad time, it's all my fault.

Not only did I plan everything, I now have to cancel every single thing. I've never had to do this before and this is agonizing to wait and pray  that we get our money back. We are at the mercy of insurance companies listening to us and having pity on us to not deny us the thousand dollars we will be out if they decide it isn't a legitimate reason to  cancel. I'm absolutely devastated. This was the last bit of money we had set aside for a vacation and now we may have nothing.

I'm supposed to be on an island right now being happy. But I'm a complete  wreck. I had an anxiety attack the day we were supposed to leave. I wailed and screamed and panicked for hours. I can't stop crying. I never want to go on a vacation again. What if it all goes to hell again? I can't keep wasting our money on things  that we can't even enjoy. How am i supposed to feel okay going on a vacation again? I can't handle the idea of wasted funds on something I can't even enjoy.

956,How to deal with recurring major crying fits?,2,yj0w0z,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/yj0w0z/how_to_deal_with_recurring_major_crying_fits/,0,"Depending on how life is at the moment, I get crying fits anywhere between once a month to once a week. And these aren’t just a couple of tears that come out of the blue. Instead, its *nonstop* crying for hours and hours on end. The tears **do not** stop pouring. I can’t quite figure out why this happens but its been happening for almost a decade now (I’m 22m and in college) and each time I just feel so empty. Its like I’m mourning something I can’t fully understand. 

If I were to venture a guess, I think its because I sometimes feel robbed of the freedom to pursue my passion in the arts (I’m from a very conservative immigrant family so this isn’t even an option). Or its a longing over the thought of what could’ve been had the circumstances of my birth been different. I also have anxiety so when I start thinking about stuff like this, I can get really worked up and often consider just leaving everything behind and running away to pursue my actual dreams regardless of how unrealistic they may be (and I actually have run away before, twice). 

But this hypothesis seems like a stretch. People go their entire lives doing things they don’t like. And its not even like I hate my current major, I actually really love it. Its just that deep down my life ambitions seem to be almost exclusively related to my true passions in the arts, even though I’ve never really had the opportunity to explore them properly. I’ve been daydreaming about them for as long as I can remember (probably since I was around 5). 

But I’m not naive. I know that a successful career in the arts is extremely rare and I already have a late start should I decide to pursue it now. Plus, my current major is extremely employable and I’m pretty good at it. Many people have advised I should secure a well-paying job first (which is essentially guaranteed with my current major) and then fund my actual passions with my day job. And this makes sense. But to be honest, I’m not sure if I even have it in me to power through anymore. With each month that passes, the crying fits seem to be getting worse. Its like a wave of emotions that comes back stronger each time. I’ve already uprooted my entire life twice before due to them and I don’t think I’ll be able to live if I continue burying these emotions. But I’m not sure if this just means I need to better manage my emotions, or if its a sign that I should actually pursue my ambitions or else risk losing myself (in terms of both my spirit/sense of self and my life) should I choose to continue ignoring them. 

What do I do? 

P.s. I’m already on anxiety meds. They help with a lot of things except for these “existential” dilemmas.",1667284082.0

966,Substances that significantly helped you with Depression and/or (Social) Anxiety Disorder,6,ygwjbp,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/ygwjbp/substances_that_significantly_helped_you_with/,4,"Hey dear community,

I already wrote single posts to these but didn‘t really got answers on my question. I‘m really looking out for herbs to help me with my diagnosed treatment resistant depression & social anxiety (and undiagnosed ADHD, so let‘s say big cognitive issues, memory, focus, learning). 

Has anyone here experiences with any of the in the titled listed herbs/supplements and wants to share his experience with it/them regarding possibly psychotropic effects? I read about following substances to be helpful for social anxiety and depression: Tongkat Ali, Gotu Kola, Lemon Balm, Magnolia Bark, Mucuna Pruriens.

It‘s not that I don‘t know about others as same as with prescription meds by a psychiatric doc or neurologist as well as talk therapy and lifestyle changes I tried a lot already, so these are especially some that I didn‘t try yet and am therefore interested in, but still very open and thankful for any other herb/supplement or alternative treatment recommendations or experience stories anyways.

I‘d really love and be so thankful for any information, experience report and/or your own „mental health and search for supplements to self medicate“-story.

1. Which substance have you tried? For how long have you been taking it at what dose?

2. What effects from which substance(s) have you experienced and how would you describe them regarding mental health factors as especially mood/depression, stress/anxiety, social anxiety/sociability/talkativeness/openness, drive/energy/motivation, anhedonia, cognition/focus/memory and side effects? Were the effects significantly helpful for mental health/mood/depression/anxiety? Profound and Psychoactive/nootropic or just weak possibly placebo?

To note:
I‘m actually on Mirtazapine (mainly antihistaminergic, little serotonergic antidepressant) and my second trial of Wellbutrin (noradrenergic/dopaminergic antidepressant). They do not help at all. They are my 12th and 13th meds now. So I can‘t (or rather don‘t want to risk it) try supplements/herbs that act on serotonin too strongly as Kanna, SAM-e, 5-HTP, Tryptophan and so on - because of possible serotonin syndrome.

Not necessary but if you want to know more about my trials to treat my mental health issues or background, here you go:

I‘ve now been trying to treat my disorder(s) since I was 17, today I’m 23. I‘ve been 15 when I first clearly noticed the symptoms, that there‘s something wrong with me, but looking back (also together with therapists) the symptoms occurred already since my childhood). So with 15 the suffering slowly started as it was only then when I started being aware of my mental health issues. 

17 years and I secretly called the psychiatric hospital near by to ask for help. Started visiting a therapist and got my first antidepressant which was a SSRI of course. After months in depth-psychological therapy and months of even increased dosage of the SSRI I didn‘t get better. This was the beginning of my trial to „heal“ myself or improve until now, 6 years later. In this time I‘ve been through 13 different meds (SSRIs, SNRIs, Wellbutrin, Antipsychotics, Tricyclics, MAO-A-Inhibitor, Atypicals, Benzodiazepines & Anticonvulsants) and 3 talk therapies with therapists (2 depth-psychological/analytical, 1 cognitive-behavioral). 

Until today nothing has helped, my symptoms are still present, contributing to every single part and moment of my life and making living a really painful big suffering from the moment I open my eyes in the morning to the moment I close them at night. I also made a general test for possible issues caused by abnormalities in vitamins, minerals, thyroide and all that microbiological stuff: nothing, everything came back with perfect values. I tried Keto diet as well as Carnivore diet, nothing. Going to the gym helps, but life is still just pure suffering. I know (and also as discussed with my therapists) that one of the biggest sources or my depression is definitely my social anxiety. I’ve always been shy/silent, even as a child, as my mother told me. So this shyness has already been or has became a disorder, social anxiety disorder. However, all the bad sides of social anxiety as social isolation, not being able to socialize well, canceling many appointments with friends, not leaving the house, not going to classes, sports or leaving the house at all led to cause or worsen my already present depression extremely and still does. It‘s as bad that on my worst days I don‘t really eat, drink, wash, move at all or go out.",1667081631.0

Update on progress and side-effects of doctor-administered ketamine infusions,6,ygqkzt,AnxietyDepression,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnxietyDepression/comments/ygqkzt/third_dose_was_yesterday_update_on_progress_and/,4,"It’s been exactly 24 hours since my 3rd infusion, and I’m still tired. When I first left the room, I was stumbling around like a drunk and passed out I. The car for an hour and a half of our 3-hour car trip. I was still physically tired and shaky from the slight up in dose a few hours afterward until I went to sleep early that night. The actual infusion was perfectly fine and had no ill-effects during and immediately after-no nausea or headaches.

I slept from 9pm until 8:30am this morning. I’m still tired, but not sleepy, just fatigued. I just took a shower to see if that will help me wake up. It didn’t, but it made me more aware what might be going on, based on my own guesses. I might have low blood pressure right now, but I don’t have any means to be sure. If I was back home, my husband could give me the cuff and check it for me on the spot. All I can go with is my gut on this one.

Memory is improving. Emotions are less wild than they were than after the second dose. Again, it feels like the emotional/neurological side of early-puberty all over again. And I’m taking an educated guess here, from my training in Education and child physiology and psychology, that my brain is taking up a lot of my body’s energy conducting some crazy rebuilding right now. 

I’m feeling more typical on a depression-scale, no intense sadness or anxiety. The paranoia and fear left me after I took the second dose, likely a result of more neurotransmitter activity. Nausea is gone completely. I’m just tired. I’m so tired. I’m swaying from fatigue. I’ve been advised to rest up. I’m hoping I’ll feel more like myself again tomorrow.

For now, I’m resting up and eating healthy while things progress. In spite of not feeling “high”, the drug is still somewhat in my system doing it’s work building neurotransmitters. I’ve heard it can be detected in urine for several days after an infusion. 

4th infusion is on the 31st. I’d like to reiterate again that this is being supervised at a clinic, and I don’t condone anyone experimenting with this without direct medical supervision.",1667067048.0
